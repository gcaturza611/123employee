                <p>
                  Many people confuse off-shoring with outsourcing. Outsourcing
                  is not about getting a cheap workforce to do as much work as
                  possible at a cheap rate in a developing economy. You can
                  outsource your social media management to Chicago if you want.
                  The point is to get work off your desk or to get specialist
                  skills that you don’t have yourself or within the team.
                  Off-shoring, on the other hand, is purely about lowering costs
                  by transferring some business processes abroad to increase
                  corporate profitability.
                  <br /><br />
                  Traditionally, only big companies are associated with
                  off-shoring, but with the age of the internet, this is also
                  accessible to smaller businesses.
                  <br /><br />
                  For small businesses, the two certainly overlap, but it’s
                  important to distinguish the difference to better identify
                  your motives for outsourcing and therefore apply the best
                  strategies. Now, it’s when you may want to look a little
                  deeper to understand the difference between offshoring and
                  outsourcing and hopefully it may help you to understand
                  better. Although the two may sound the same and have some
                  similar properties, there are some distinct differences
                  between offshoring and outsourcing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Offshoring usually offers a cost-saving advantage by getting
                  work done in different countries. While outsourcing refers to
                  the process of having work contracted out to a third-party
                  company.
                  <br /><br />
                  It is completely possible to outsource work without having to
                  offshore it. The benefits of outsourcing are aplenty – you can
                  take advantage of specialized skills from a different company,
                  receive cost efficiency bonuses as well as improved labour
                  flexibility. Basically, outsourcing helps to complete multiple
                  jobs at a faster rate, reducing costs, while running it more
                  effectively in terms of profitable operations within your
                  organization.
                  <br /><br />
                  Next, let’s talk a little bit more on the benefits of
                  offshoring which include taking advantage of lower prices from
                  skilled labour in a different country. In most cases, the
                  offering of offshore options can also provide you with better
                  availability of labour and materials as well as a much larger
                  talent pool for getting things done.
                  <br /><br />
                  Similarly, for offshoring, it allows your core staff to focus
                  on more important tasks and to spend less time on tasks that
                  don’t require immediate attention. Hence, this helps your
                  staff to be more time focused on the bigger picture that will
                  require more time to work on especially when it comes to
                  making strategic decisions that will help your business to
                  grow and develop.
                  <br /><br />
                  You must be wondering how outsourcing first came about? It all
                  started as early as 1980 and throughout the modern business
                  world, this is something that happens quite often. Companies
                  continue to grow and in order to have the skills that are
                  necessary to continue building a company, specialized skills
                  need to be sourced quickly and effectively in order to scale.
                  <br /><br />
                  With both outsourcing and offshoring solutions working
                  together, it’s possible to achieve high-quality value and
                  expansion for your company. It is important however to
                  remember to differentiate between the two in their full
                  definition.
                  <br /><br />
                  While you can outsource and offshore at the same time,
                  offshoring doesn’t always mean outsourcing. Offshoring could
                  be an extension of your local team but in a different country,
                  a new labour supply or other aspects of production that can
                  improve the overall performance of your company. Keep the main
                  differences between these two in mind if you’re interested in
                  making improvements in your company through a proposal to
                  outsource or offshore.

                  Some businesses can handle normal daily activities but need
                  outside help to take on new projects that don’t justify
                  another employee. Other businesses are just struggling to
                  manage day-to-day business. Still others are seeking ways to
                  get more done or cut expenses in this challenging economy.
                  <br /><br />
                  There are many valid reasons to consider outsourcing, but here
                  are some of the most compelling.
                  <br /><br />
                  Focus on core business activities. For many businesses, the
                  primary motivation to outsource is that it frees owners,
                  managers and employees to spend their time on income
                  generating activities. Improve opportunities for growth.
                  Frequently opportunities for company growth and a desire to
                  expand business operations exist, but resources to make it
                  happen are lacking. Increase efficiency and effectiveness. In
                  many cases, outsourcing allows access to expert talent.
                  Outsource service firms can offer innovative approaches, the
                  latest technology, and creative, cutting-edge solutions that
                  otherwise aren’t available. Improve your bottom line by
                  decreasing your expenses. A skilled contractor or firm can
                  generally perform work less expensively than a full-time
                  employee can, and the costs of hiring, training, and
                  maintaining employees are eliminated, as are taxes and
                  benefits. Here’s what you can, and should, be outsourcing.
                  <br /><br />
                  1. Administrative tasks
                  <br /><br />
                  Scheduling, travel arrangements, data entry, typing and other
                  administrative tasks can usually be handled by a virtual
                  assistant or administrative service. While these tasks are
                  crucial to the proper functioning of any business, they are
                  not usually core business activities.
                  <br /><br />
                  Where to find help: Assistant Match, Assist, match businesses
                  with screened administrative service providers and offer
                  directories of professionally trained virtual assistants.
                  <br /><br />
                  2. Lead generation and customer service
                  <br /><br />
                  Sales calls are often a matter of numbers; more calls equal
                  more sales and leads. Once the initial outreach has been made,
                  closing the sale can be handled by the internal sales force. A
                  talented salesperson’s skills can be better utilized to close
                  sales and handle clients, rather than make cold calls. It can
                  also be a great deal more efficient to outsource customer
                  support than it is to maintain a qualified support staff,
                  especially for product-based companies.
                  <br /><br />
                  3. Accounting and financial duties
                  <br /><br />
                  Accounting firms or individuals can help with many financial
                  services including bookkeeping, invoicing and accounts payable
                  and receivable, as well as financial reporting, analysis and
                  planning. Outsourcing payroll processing alone can save
                  considerable hours, headaches and dollars. Many financial
                  contractors will bundle these tasks for even greater savings.
                  <br /><br />
                  4. Marketing
                  <br /><br />
                  Effective marketing determines how both brand and company
                  reputation are perceived in the marketplace. A marketing firm
                  or consultant can often provide an outside perspective that an
                  internal marketing staff cannot. Professional freelance
                  writers can develop higher-quality, polished content that will
                  improve marketing efforts. Website design, brand development,
                  press releases and online marketing duties such as social
                  media, blogging and search engine optimization are good
                  candidates for outsourcing as well.
                  <br /><br />
                  5. IT operations
                  <br /><br />
                  It can be extremely expensive to handle IT operations
                  in-house. The average business has limited ability and
                  knowledge to manage all of its IT needs. Unless you’re an IT
                  company, IT is a maintenance and repair function, not a core
                  business activity. The potential advantages of outsourcing IT
                  tasks are enormous.
                  <br /><br />
                  6. Human resources
                  <br /><br />
                  Employee acquisition and human resource functions can easily
                  be administered by an outside agency. Outside firms are more
                  skilled at advertising, screening suitable applicants and
                  checking references. Using an HR or employment service to
                  manage employee benefits can also be wise, since they must
                  stay up to date on the latest employment laws and standards.
                  <br /><br />
                  Often, the best way to locate high-quality outsourcing
                  prospects is through recommendations from your professional
                  network. A referral from someone you know and trust is a much
                  more reliable gauge of quality and is usually based on the
                  level of skill and not simply the cheapest cost. Professional
                  groups or associations and LinkedIn can also be great sources.

                  The global economic environment is caught up with an
                  interesting trend known as outsourcing. Business outsourcing
                  covers different areas of a company or organization’s business
                  activities and operations. Outsourcing has completely changed
                  the mode of operating business in this present dispensation.
                  <br /><br />
                  Basically, there is in-country outsourcing and offshore
                  outsourcing. When a company outsources part of its business
                  activities to an outsourcing contractor in the same country
                  where the business is residing, this is called in-country
                  outsourcing. But, when the outsourcing contractor resides in
                  another part of the world other than the country where the
                  outsourced company resides, this is known as offshore
                  outsourcing. Business IT is one of the most outsourced
                  operations or functions, both in-country and offshore.
                  <br /><br />
                  Why Should You Outsource Your Business Operations
                  <br /><br />
                  1. It can be cost-effective
                  <br /><br />
                  Business outsourcing can be cost-effective sometimes compared
                  to carrying out the functions in-house. The overall cost of
                  certain areas of business operations such as IT Management can
                  be greatly reduced by embarking on outsourcing. Generally,
                  areas covered under cost-savings include re-pricing, scope
                  reduction, cost-restructuring, re-negotiation as well as
                  quality levels definitions.
                  <br /><br />
                  2. Access to Talent
                  <br /><br />
                  An organization or company gains access to a larger talent
                  pool when it chooses business outsourcing. Such company would
                  also become a beneficiary of sustainable source of skills,
                  particularly in IT, engineering as well as science. This is a
                  big plus to a company that has limited or less knowledge and
                  skill set in these specified areas. So, a company needs not to
                  lag in certain areas just because it does not have the
                  required manpower skills or adequate facilities in such area.
                  Outsourcing has made everything possible for a business or
                  organization.
                  <br /><br />
                  3. Liability Shift
                  <br /><br />
                  As a company outsources specific business processes or
                  functions that are not within its core expertise, it
                  indirectly shifts or transfers part of the company’s liability
                  to the outsourcing contractor. Thus, the outsourcing company
                  bears part or whole responsibility of any undesirable out
                  come. Well, it all depends on the terms of the contract that
                  is binding on both parties. Now, when embarking on business
                  outsourcing, ensure that sufficient research is carried out on
                  the outsourcing contractor. Some of the things you should
                  research about the company include;
                  <br /><br />
                  Proof of required skill possession in the intended business
                  operation or function. An outsourcing company that is
                  specialized in IT outsourcing may not perform satisfactorily
                  in HR outsourcing, except it has multi-skilled staff. It is
                  really more efficient to contract a company that has proven
                  skills in the business area you need outsourced.
                  <br /><br />
                  Check the portfolio: the portfolio should contain
                  certifications in specific outsourcing areas as well as
                  general outsourcing certifications. It should also contain
                  proof of membership to relevant outsourcing body, either
                  locally or internationally. Also, references of past projects
                  and their contacts should be part of the portfolio of a
                  competent business outsourcing vendor.
                  <br /><br />
                  Business outsourcing will help your business in several areas,
                  including gaining a competitive edge in the present harsh
                  business environment.

                <p>
                  Companies can outsource any position whatsoever. Still, today,
                  we see companies using it for non-fundamental roles, those
                  whose function is to provide support to the central
                  infrastructure of the company or aid in the day-to-day
                  operations of the company.
                  <br /><br />
                  Due to some misunderstandings all around, outsourcing can
                  sometimes be a rather polarizing term. Employees tend to see
                  it as a threat to their job while employers think that the
                  whole process of outsourcing can be more trouble than it’s
                  worth. Under the wrong circumstances, both of these things can
                  definitely be true. If however, the outsourcing process is
                  handled properly, there’s no reason for the process to be a
                  problematic one.
                  <br /><br />
                  First of all, in addressing the employee issue, there’s no
                  reason for your business to incur the expense of buying all of
                  the necessary equipment and hiring the personnel to run a
                  proper IT department in the first place if IT is not what your
                  business does. These are expenses that your business has no
                  need to carry the burden of to begin with, so jobs that should
                  exist should not be jobs that are in danger. Minimizing the
                  costs of operation for your business in an area such as this
                  allows your business to make more money and, if necessary,
                  allows your business the freedom to create other, more
                  essential, positions since funds that would have been eaten up
                  by another department have been freed up.
                  <br /><br />
                  Concerning the difficulty of the outsourcing process, there’s
                  no reason that transition should be a very difficult one.
                  There are entire companies out there that base their operation
                  on providing outsourced services. The outsourcing process can
                  be as simple as identifying one of these companies that best
                  meets your needs, making sure that the company is reliable and
                  trustworthy, and letting the deal go forward naturally from
                  there. These companies already have the overhead and other
                  necessary equipment to house and provide the relevant services
                  and they have already hired the appropriate personnel to staff
                  these operations. There is no need for you or your business to
                  incur the time consuming, expensive process of building and
                  acquiring all of the necessary physical property and to go
                  through the tedious work of hiring the appropriate workers to
                  staff the operation.
                  <br /><br />
                  It can be as simple as doing an internet search, investigating
                  the returned results to make sure that they are valid, and
                  placing an order; that is all it takes to outsource certain
                  aspects of your business. This saves you costs on expenses and
                  it saves you time, thus keeping you from misspending some very
                  valuable resources that could be working harder for you in
                  other areas of your business.
                  <br /><br />

                  Many companies find themselves trying to do it all, but when
                  it comes to filling the sales pipeline it might be most
                  beneficial to place the process of collecting leads through
                  digital efforts in the hands of the most capable. If that’s
                  in-house, great! However, the complex world of digital
                  marketing is often more cost effective to partner with a
                  third-party expert.
                  <br /><br />
                  Focus on what your business does best.
                  <br /><br />
                  When launching a business, it’s critical to do what you are
                  good at; sticking with your core competency is an absolute
                  must. So, before deciding whether to partner with the experts
                  you need to understand your company and its capabilities.
                  <br /><br />
                  If you’re fantastic at creating a product, but not so good at
                  taking it to market, then that should be your main focus and
                  you should let the experts handle creating the demand to drive
                  sales.
                  <br /><br />
                  A lot of companies have limited resources in the way of
                  marketing, with interns or a very small team responsible for
                  driving all channels including email, paid search, search
                  engine optimization (SEO), content creation, social media
                  presence, etc. While most of these channels are relatively
                  easy to setup, not everyone understand how to drive results or
                  there are simply too many to manage efficiently and
                  effectively for a small team.
                  <br /><br />
                  Marketing is not cheap and is often one of the first budgets
                  to get cut when costs need to decrease. The general rule of
                  thumb suggests between 6-20 percent of total revenue for most
                  businesses’ marketing budget. This includes all paid
                  advertisements, all of the necessary tools, and the salaries
                  of the staff members if you choose to keep your efforts
                  in-house.
                  <br /><br />
                  Inbound marketing is all about creating new leads for your
                  business. If you opt for in-house, full-time digital marketing
                  staff, it’s going to entail a significant investment of both
                  time and money.
                  <br /><br />
                  Financial concerns aside, the digital marketing industry is
                  changing all the time. Frankly, the task of planning and
                  carrying out your marketing efforts may be so time-consuming
                  that it makes it near-impossible to stay up to date with every
                  new strategy and trend that comes along.
                  <br /><br />
                  Third-party partners dedicate their entire business to making
                  sure they are aware of the latest trends in digital marketing,
                  so the burden of doing so does not fall to their client. They
                  are often flexible and have the ability to pivot based on new
                  technology or the latest best practice.
                  <br /><br />
                  Perhaps you’re not ready to relinquish complete control of
                  your digital marketing efforts. There is always the option of
                  taking a blended approach and only partnering with the experts
                  for tasks you feel the least comfortable managing like SEO
                  which can be rather complex.
                  <br /><br />
                  They will be able to help you in the planning stage to help
                  you best utilize your budget to help you avoid gaps and keep
                  new leads coming into your sales funnel.

                <p>
                  Frankly speaking, operating cost can overtake small businesses
                  very fast. However, quite a lot of entrepreneurs and business
                  owners hamper their revenue development by doing all in order
                  to save a few amounts in the process. Tactical outsourcing
                  solves this predicament. A lot of entrepreneurs and business
                  owners rebuff outsourcing due to the additional cost.
                  <br /><br />
                  Nevertheless, they didn’t border to work out the value of
                  chances lost as a result of their investing too much time in
                  energy-consuming jobs that can best be left to others. In a
                  nutshell, they save cost without making money.
                  <br /><br />
                  Consequently, discussed here are five major outsourcing
                  opportunities for small entrepreneurs and small business
                  owners in the spirit of creating extra time to develop their
                  various businesses.
                  <br /><br />
                  1. Editing
                  <br /><br />
                  Look for somebody who is a professional in editing and word
                  crafting if your business needs a lot of written materials.
                  Outsource your content creation and editing aspect of your
                  business to a third party to guarantee accuracy.
                  <br /><br />
                  2. Accounting
                  <br /><br />
                  Apart from the fact that accounting is energy-sapping and
                  time-consuming, it is more of a specialty trade. Outsourcing
                  accounting and bookkeeping aspects of your business to
                  certified accountants is quite beneficial as they are familiar
                  with the ethics and rules that can keep you away from trouble.
                  <br /><br />
                  Hence, look for a good bookkeeper to carry out the day-to-day
                  keeping of your accounting records. In addition, you need a
                  great payroll company to be in charge of paychecks,
                  withholding taxes and CPA for tax accounting.
                  <br /><br />
                  3. Banking
                  <br /><br />
                  In the present day, a good number of banks have small business
                  experts who are capable of helping you with grants, loans,
                  lines of credit, cash flow, and lots more. if you are looking
                  for money to operate your business, your outsourcing banker
                  can come to your aid.
                  <br /><br />
                  4. Social media
                  <br /><br />
                  Take it or leave it, reaching out on social media platforms
                  can be time consuming. However, there are some third parties
                  out there that are ready to take up this aspect of your
                  business. They will respond to posts, post your messages,
                  articles, and look for connected people to link to, and many
                  more. Outsource this critical aspect of your business.
                  <br /><br />
                  5. Artwork
                  <br /><br />
                  This comprises of letterhead, logos, and website art among
                  others. Few business owners can carry out this assignment
                  well. Therefore, look for extraordinarily gifted designers who
                  can take care of all of your artwork needs for at an
                  affordable rate.
                  <br /><br />
                  By and large, do your best and consider outsourcing the rest
                  to professionals on the field.

                  In the world of Outsourcing, the various classes of projects
                  that can be outsourced are numerous. The company holds the
                  discretion as to the projects to outsource, and the projects
                  to keep in-house. Companies outsource Procurement as a
                  service, to third party in a bid to take that load off them,
                  and save cost.
                  <br /><br />
                  Projects like Procurement could be a sensitive aspect in most
                  organizations. The concerns of handling procurement, whether
                  in-house or outsourced, usually border around cutting costs/
                  unnecessary expenditure on the company’s needs, as they are
                  more about finding out ways of investing on things that will
                  yield direct income to the organization.
                  <br /><br />
                  It is important that you are able to ascertain whether or not
                  you are hitting your organization’s targets with you
                  Procurement Outsourcing partnership. We notice that many
                  companies do not have this testimony, and more often than not,
                  run at a loss or are just not achieving their expectations or
                  goals by outsourcing their procurement.
                  <br /><br />
                  Don’t only think “save money”; also think – can I reinvest the
                  monies saved as a result of outsourcing my procurement needs?
                  <br /><br />
                  In the apprehensions of the risks of engaging procurement
                  firms to handle your procurement needs, keep in mind that no
                  business is without risks. Sudden unforeseen matters can creep
                  up on the smoothest sails, and sometimes, the Innovations of
                  the crew are just what they need to stay afloat. Outsourcing
                  firms are usually that crew that work through unforeseen
                  challenges with their expertise and methods “outside the
                  book”, to make sure they deliver to in record time, and
                  meeting the expectations of their clients.
                  <br /><br />
                  Because procurements outsourcing entail some multi-reliance
                  and optioning, there can be a whole lot of damage control when
                  it comes to the relationships between the distributors or
                  sellers and the clients who happen to be the procurement
                  outsourcing firms, and if not – the company directly in need
                  of the items. In such cases of dealing directly with
                  suppliers, companies are faced with monotonous delivery, or
                  sometimes disappointments that could lead to a major strain in
                  the seller and buyer relationship. Time taken in searching for
                  new (equally or more reliable) options may cause a stalling,
                  and in some cases, a major setback in company operations. That
                  is where the role of a procurement outsourcing firm comes in
                  handy, where the setbacks one or two suppliers would have
                  caused a company, are prevented.
                  <br /><br />
                  The fears of diversion of clients’ patronage should not be a
                  challenge where this is properly managed by the organization.
                  <br /><br />
                  Outsourcing firms are usually your “invisible partners” that
                  work underground in making the whole wheel turn.

                  modern hospital is such a model for outsourcing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Early in the days, hospitals barely had effective medicines
                  and operations were catastrophic. Between the 19th and the
                  20th century, hospitals had a way better chance of improving
                  health as medicine became “scientific”. As health alongside
                  the hospitals in developed countries, sicknesses like
                  tuberculosis, cholera began to receive less focus as hospitals
                  concentrated on more challenging issues like cancer, genetic
                  research and heart disease.
                  <br /><br />
                  To meet up with the new challenges, hospitals needed advanced
                  and sophisticated equipment’s. It was no longer enough to have
                  lots of beds and test tubes in labs. Although medical
                  practitioners were talented, they lacked the required training
                  to utilize and maintain these modern equipment’s. Hence,
                  outsourcing became very important.
                  <br /><br />
                  Now, a network of organizations such as insurance groups,
                  governmentorganisa?ons, education, specialty clinics as well
                  as the recent data outsourcers(who make use of tools like IBM
                  Watson) work together to treat patients.
                  <br /><br />
                  Let us analyze how the transformation of hospitals foretell
                  the evolution of outsourcing.
                  <br /><br />
                  Outsourcing of the last generation: In nations like China and
                  India, outsourcing used to be induced by lower wages.
                  Businesses hired more people offshore than they had onshore.
                  However, offshore companies had less equipment and were less
                  automated. The mode of work had to change, but the goals of
                  all parties were met. The offshore economy had to spend money
                  purchasing equipment which raised operational cost and slowed
                  down implementation.
                  <br /><br />
                  Size: While Europe and the United States already had big
                  factories handling car and airplane production, outsourcing
                  completely scaled when it was moved to China. Over the past 10
                  years, China built over 500 new cites in order to accommodate
                  workers that would be needed by new industries. This scaling
                  of operations created a new type of outsourcing. For instance,
                  outsourcing industries that assemble electronic parts.
                  <br /><br />
                  Increased reliability: In the early days of outsourcing, it
                  was perceived as unreliable. Some projects like “Lift and
                  Shift” failed. With the scaling of outsourcing at the
                  beginning of the 21st century, about 50% of outsourcing was a
                  success. Those who failed lacked necessary skills, or skipped
                  some steps. Outsourcing has now become more successful
                  generally, especially when creditable outsourcing sites are
                  engaged.
                  <br /><br />
                  Computer support: Large industries used to run their own IT
                  department, right now the likes of Microsoft Azure and Amazon
                  Web Services (AWS) handle IT responsibilities of plenty
                  enterprises. For small businesses in America, marketplaces
                  like Amazon have literarily snapped up warehousing and
                  distribution.
                  <br /><br />
                  Advancement in automation and robot invention via technology
                  are revolutionizing manufacturing models, which is leading to
                  more business activities being outsourced, hence the need for
                  multi-dimensional outsourcing.

                  The most important benefit you stand to gain with recruitment
                  process outsourcing is increased cost effectiveness. In
                  addition, you are freeing up time to search for the right
                  workforce and re-targeting it at tasks that will directly grow
                  and expand your business. However, make sure you only hire a
                  skillful and experienced offshore recruitment vendor.
                  <br /><br />
                  Here are the highlights of the gains that come with
                  outsourcing recruitment process;
                  <br /><br />
                  Benefit #1: You will Spend Far Less
                  <br /><br />
                  It’s a well known fact that once outsourcing solution is
                  adopted for any aspect of business, huge cost saving would
                  follow. This is no different when recruitment process
                  outsourcing is involved. Besides, the outsourced vendor would
                  deploy innovative recruitment techniques, combined with
                  industry best practices for the task. That’s not all, the huge
                  cost that you would have incurred to train the newly hired
                  staff in-house is significantly cut back when recruitment
                  process vendors take up the whole aspects of recruitment,
                  including training.
                  <br /><br />
                  Benefit #2: You can be sure of Hiring Qualified Workforce
                  <br /><br />
                  When you take advantage of RPO (Recruitment Process
                  Outsourcing), you have increased chances of hiring the right
                  people for the task in question. This is especially true when
                  the outsourcing vendor has in its team people that specialize
                  in the business task you have need of workers. So, instead of
                  guess work, the appropriate criteria are employed in hiring
                  and interviewing prospects. Subsequently, the quality outcome
                  when you engage the workforce will help boost the image of
                  your business.
                  <br /><br />
                  Benefit #3: Fast-Forward Recruitment Process
                  <br /><br />
                  It’s faster to use an outsourcing recruitment vendor to hire a
                  workforce. This is because the vendor is already familiar with
                  the terrain and knows exactly what to look out for in
                  candidates. As a result, you don’t have to experience delay in
                  finding and hiring the right people for your team. Delay in
                  getting the right workers can potentially affect any business
                  negatively. It’s good to know you can completely eliminate
                  such delay by leveraging RPO.
                  <br /><br />
                  Benefit #4: You can Hardly go wrong with RPO
                  <br /><br />
                  The bottom line is; with all the benefits of RPO highlighted
                  above, you can hardly go wrong with your recruitment process.
                  And, when you get it right with your choice of employees, you
                  can be sure of faster business growth and expansion,
                  culminating to increased profits ultimately.
                  <br /><br />
                  So, do not delay any longer in embracing recruitment process
                  outsourcing.

                  When it comes to outsourcing, different people have different
                  opinions. And, some of such opinions are held tightly in
                  ignorance. This article will focus on some outsourcing myths
                  and the real truth about such myths. So, keep reading to learn
                  more.
                  <br /><br />
                  Myth #1: Outsourcing is only for Big the Corporations
                  <br /><br />
                  Well, at the inception of this business solution called
                  outsourcing, this myth was completely true. Then, only the big
                  corporations and high class individuals could afford to
                  implement outsourcing. It wasn’t within the reach of medium
                  and small businesses. But, thankfully, the advent of the
                  internet has eliminated this myth completely! It doesn’t
                  matter the size your business, you can now use outsourcing in
                  so many beneficial ways that include cost cutting, access to
                  larger skill pool, and affordable expertise. The internet
                  eliminated the big gap and provided more outsourcing vendors,
                  both onshore and offshore. In fact, offshore outsourcing has
                  become even more popular as it facilitates far better cost
                  saving.
                  <br /><br />
                  Outsourcing cost has now become highly competitive as there
                  are thousands of providers. The best part is that you can bid
                  for the best rate with just a click of the button and from
                  your comfort zone.
                  <br /><br />
                  Myth #2: Outsourcing is Drying up Job at Home
                  <br /><br />
                  Another outsourcing myth that is indeed causing a lot of
                  hullabaloos recently is that offshore outsourcing is taking
                  jobs away from home, rendering many citizens jobless. Well,
                  this is not really true, depending on how you look at it. The
                  truth is, anyone who is jobless at home has probably not
                  distinguished himself from the pack. If you are really an
                  authority in what you do, there’s a job waiting for you at
                  home and you can even be the one dictating the pace in terms
                  of remuneration.
                  <br /><br />
                  Besides, the companies who outsource jobs abroad also have a
                  portion that they reserve at home. The whole truth is; you
                  can’t stop businesses from outsourcing jobs offshore since it
                  provides them with significant cost saving benefits.
                  <br /><br />
                  Myth #3: Quality is not always guaranteed
                  <br /><br />
                  The truth is, whether or not quality is guaranteed depends on
                  the person hiring. Even if you decide to use in-house staff,
                  things can still go wrong if you did not hire the right
                  persons for the task. So, if you are not getting the desired
                  quality from outsourcing, it’s simply because you did not
                  employ due diligence in hiring an outsourcing vendor.
                  <br /><br />
                  So, you should lay these outsourcing myths to rest from
                  henceforth!
