              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              She has helped build a database of customers. Right now I’m here
              at Super Teaching at CEO Space, I take my electronic notes
              everyday, I highlight the parts that are action items, I email her
              my notes everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all
              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful
              that I came across her and she’s going to save me a lot of time
              and money.

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.

              Hey this is Mike Evans here,and i just wanna share how much i
              really enjoy of working with 123Employee, and the reason i
              enjoying working with them cause they make me money, i have a full
              time assistant he’s in Philippines and he works at the same hour
              as he may come at the 12noon my time and leave at 9pm my time
              which is good for me cause i get up at 10AM, start working around
              noon, but the most important thing in this guy done for me is
              after i trained them is that he is now able to come up with the
              ideas on his own to help me make money. i mean that’s the most
              important thing. I’m in a very complicated business, the internet
              marketing site, i have a lot of links, and a lot of things that
              have in perfect order for me to make money and first i was able to
              train them to do that which is the most important thing, i was
              able to do that, and for me quite on he’s never make a mistake
              except when i gave him a wrong information.But on his in, he
              hasn’t make mistake, that the first thing but he is able to take
              initiative which is i asked him to do and make decision on his
              own.And then, also offer suggestions to help me make more money.
              So a lot of time he will think of things to do that i haven’t
              taught for hand focus on and for me that’s the biggest value that
              I’m getting from my personal assistant with 123Employee who’s in
              the Philippines. The last thing i wanna say is you know, i was
              very skeptical first, i have tried other virtual assistant from
              India and China and Philippines as well, and you know i thought i
              could give them a lot of cheaper and i would found it on my
              own.And you know what i found is first of all these are the people
              they work from their home when their computer is break they stop
              on their work. With 123Employee that you can see they have their
              office, with the generators, air condition and lights and you know
              everyday that everything is gonna be working.And then you know, he
              has a seat and a desk in a real office and because of that I’ve
              got consistency from my experience with them.So again. I’m a (?)
              you kind of person and i never thought i want one or another
              assistant but now i found if i able double and triple and actually
              quintuple the amount of income I’m making because of my
              123Employee assistant highly, highly recommend. Thanks! I’m Mike
              Evans

              Hi I am Victoria Bowman and I have a PhD in Homeopathy in natural
              medicine. My business is MyRealHealth.com and I love 123Employee.
              In fact Charlie my Virtual Assistant is amazing and kudos to
              Richard who is my manager with 123Employee. The things that have
              happened since I have started with them are they have been
              submitting my articles to Ezine and they are getting published.
              Also, we are doing an email marketing program for one of the
              products that I represent and that is going very well. They also
              have edited my YouTube videos so I am all over YouTube and people
              are hitting it. They are spreading the word and I am getting more
              business as well as increasing my clout and my Pinterest presence
              on the web. So I endorse 123Employee. Take a look you will be glad
              you did. Bye now.

              Hello my name is Sam Batier with Super-trainer.com. Super
              trainer.com is a blog about showing personal trainers and fitness
              professionals how to automate their business and not to work so
              much in their business while on their business. As we know being
              the personal trainer most of my life, it was really bad because I
              had to get up at four o’clock in the morning, Will train clients
              from five o’clock till noon and then maybe get a little break from
              about 12 to 2 or 3 o’clock and you have to go back, repeat from 4
              to 8- 9 o’clock and I’d never had any life. I was making an ok
              money but I had no life, no time to meet someone special, no time
              to have a social life, no time to do laundering. Nothing! So over
              years I systematized my own dreams called fitconcepts.com and I
              systematized my other bootcamp businesses. I have bootcamps right
              now. I have six bootcamps in California , I have six bootcamps in
              Chicago so I automate those business and I barely ever dare. So
              what I’m now I’m teaching other fitness professionals how to
              automate their business and be able to have a life. I mean, I
              don’t care how much money out there you making but if you don’t
              have a life it’s really not worth it. Now today I have a beautiful
              wife, I have a beautiful children and I can probably work wherever
              I want and I couldn’t done that without having a team of people
              that I can rely on to and what ‘i mean by that is somebody I can
              be able to call and be able to get a job done and job done
              correctly and a job done for a reasonable price. So that’s why I
              rely on 123Employee because 123Employee has a virtual assistants
              that are professional, that speak the language, that are
              supervised and somebody I can actually call. A lot of times we
              have a virtual assistants before I couldn’t get a hold of them, I
              didn’t know if they are working my project or not I couldn’t rely
              the message to them and there was a language barrier but
              123Employee they have taken the virtual assistant industry to a
              whole new level and it’s just a breath of fresh air that I can
              totally rely on to someone and know that the job gets done and
              they guarantee it. This is the cool thing about it, if something
              didn’t work they guarantee their job and they always on top of it.
              Great service! I cannot have been here at this event without
              123Employee. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

              Hey this is Mike Crow with the Millionaire inspector community. I
              also coach other coaches that are trying to create their own next
              program. You can go out to coachblueprint.com if you would like to
              get a free report on that. But that’s not what I really wanna here
              for. I really want you to know one of the secrets I used to help
              grow my coaching business. Now currently I’m using 123Employee.
              And I have a young lady by the name Sheila and she just does
              incredible job. She’s helping us do list building, she’s helping
              us set meet up groups, and she’s helping us make sure all kinds of
              information fully enforced out there in the internet. Now I’m
              gonna tell you another secret, I have ten people that worked for
              me and I can touch any single day. I didn’t hire the virtual
              assistant for me, I hired it for my top two people and then I
              actually said: hey you know what I said we’ve gonna have get rid
              of these person, I don’t think they are doing that much force and
              both of them almost quit on me because they said if you do that we
              gotta do all her work and we don’t wanna do that. We wanna make
              sure that you keep her. So you know what she ain’t goin anywhere
              anytime soon. 123Employee has been taken really good care of my
              people which mean my people taken really good care of me, which
              means more business. Daven thank you. 123Employee thank you so
              much guys!!!

              Hey guys. This is Tracy Walker with keepallthecash.com and before
              getting plugged into 123Employee, I was probably like a lot of
              entrepreneurs where I had so many different ideas and so many
              different things going on in my business that I just couldn’t
              implement them all. <br /><br />
              So I decided to take a chance, get started with 123Employee, get
              my own VA and what she does for me is she does all of my
              marketing. If I say to her listen, I need you to post a blog post
              for me, she’ll post it. If I ask her to do any keyword research
              for me, she does that. She does a lot of my syndication, meaning
              that she posts on Facebook for me, she posts on Pinterest for me,
              she does my Instagram work for me. She does my articles and doing
              back-linking and all these wonderful things and she uploads my
              videos to my YouTube channel. <br /><br />
              So if you’re ready to outsource your business and actually get to
              back to living your life and having fun in your business, I highly
              recommend you get plugged into 123Employee, Daven will take are of
              you.

              Hi, I’m Marbeth Dunn, yourjoyjourney.com. And I’m so happy today
              to tell you about Daven Michaels 123Employee. I was a little
              reticent at the beginning to work with a VA, I didn’t quite
              understand how it was going to be but I love my VA.
              <br /><br />
              He audits my audios; I have a radio show, radio show host of the
              Great Metamorphosis on the Law of Attraction radio network. He
              edits my audios, he’s fantastic. And he also posts on social
              media, he posts my blogs and he posts them all over social media
              for me, because you know as a busy entrepreneur you don’t have
              time to do all this yourself. So Daven’s people have saved my
              life, made me have more time in the day to play. Thank you, Daven.

              Hi my name is Gail Kinsbury and I worked with speakers, trainers,
              authors all over the world and I help them get on the stages, I’m
              producing events I travel a tone. I’m a single mom with three kids
              and a very very busy life. I decided to go ahead and used an
              employee from Daven Michaels with 123Employee and what we’ve done
              with that is. a time that is given me back in my life and to be
              able to spend with my kids. I can focus on my clients for just
              having her do a little bit of things like research foe an event,
              getting links out of my affiliate account, getting things posted,
              creating a twitter profile for me that I never had time to even
              bother with and where how to do it, how to put new picture on a
              twitter page,Clueless!?! She got it done in less than two hours
              and it’s just been a really great seamless experience working with
              123Employee. if you have the opportunity, I suggest you do it
              too!.

              I now a working consultants I wanted to share to you my experience
              with my VA with 123Employee. Since I have used my VA she has been
              phenomenal, she ha handled all of my social media marketing my
              email marketing even taken my inbound phone calls and she is doing
              an amazing job, my staff loves her, she’s easy to work with, she’s
              a hard worker. One great experience is I was at the seminar and I
              checked my email and in a few hours i had a hundred and forty
              three twitter followers just following my emails.SO for those that
              are small business owners and entrepreneurs I recommend
              123Employee, they would just take all paper works headache away.
              They are willing to do I mean they are just at your service, you
              give them everything you need and they will take care the rest so
              I highly recommend 123Employee.

              Hi I’m Alka Dalal and I’m from Santa Monica California. Well I
              have something to give, to contribute to because I’m a 123employee
              client and not just client I’m client for just 1 full year. I’ve
              used them and Ive been very very happy with them and the reason I
              say that because it freed lot of my time off and this is what I
              came up with my book, ” Creative Genius: Tips to Unleash yours.
              This is a great book, it’s on Amazon.com and the reason I could
              right this book and I’m also writing many other books, my second
              book is coming up soon the reason is that I’m using 123Employee.
              They’re very wonderful to me, they do all my social networking, my
              articles posting and so many things they do for me that it frees
              my time off and I do what I’m good at like to train leaders in
              creativity and internet marketing so I do lots of those things for
              myself. I write books, and I go around and talk to people network
              so I can do so many otter things where I have my 123Employee doing
              all the works for me in the back end in the office and the are
              very very easy to deal with, they speak excellent English, they
              write excellent English and I am really very very happy, so go for
              it people, 123Employee!
            </p>

              Hi, this is Dr. Marc Kossman of Personal Success Marketing and I
              have high words of praise for 123Employee and Daven Michaels. Our
              personal assistant John is the secret ingredient that allowed us
              to take our books fly somewhere on the rank of 3 Million on
              Amazon.com to a number 1 bestseller in our category. There are
              just so many things that you can outsource as an author and get
              the job done and so you got to check out 123Employee, we very
              highly recommend it did the job for us. Right, it was like a
              breath of fresh air and what did he do for us? He cleared the
              sight didn’t he? He just wiped it all gone, it’s all gone so that
              we can focus on getting our book done. We got the book, we got it
              done and now we have John.

              I am Anushka Drescher from Burkley, California and 2 weeks ago I
              started working with 123Employee. I got a wonderful assistant
              named Maria and she has helped me so much just in the last 2
              weeks. Some of the examples the way she’s helped me is that she
              has created a mind map for my whole business. All of the things
              that I need to do, she’s put them on a visual map online. She has
              helped build a database of customers. Right now I’m here at Super
              Teaching at CEO Space, I take my electronic notes everyday, I
              highlight the parts that are action items, I email her my notes
              everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all the
              actions I’ve said I need to take. When I get home I know exactly
              what I need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to
              please, she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so
              grateful that I came across her and she’s going to save me a lot
              of time and money. She’s going to be preparing a newsletter for me
              that I get paid for $500 to do it once a month. It’ll take her
              about 2 hours to do it once I train her and I will pay for her
              entire salary for the whole month. I love 123Employee!

              Hello my name is Chris Carter I’m a local niche marketer and
              online marketer. We used 123Employee for our outbound sales for a
              lot of product and services and things we do inside of our
              business that it saves me a tone of time. In fact one of the
              gentlemen Luijey was fantastic and helping us builds the list and
              put things together. Folks when you wanna do the things or half
              things done that you don’t need to do that blowing to pay crater;
              you know what? You just might not know how to do and you know you
              need to get it done make sure you join 123Employee and have it
              done for you. You deserve the amount of time in your life that you
              are enjoying instead of working

              Hi, Darius Askaripour here from the Innovative Investors wanting
              to make a real quick video for my good friend Daven Michaels.
              Daven owns a company called 123Employee and if you’re not aware of
              getting virtual assistants you need to get on it and get on it
              fast. You know, virtual assistants are intricate part to any
              business but they really help you bridge the gap of needing help,
              of getting employees, of training people because we know good and
              well that employees are not cheap, usually they are not. We know
              that in turn sometimes they are a little iffy, they are a little
              shaky but having a virtual assistant is a necessary component to
              any business that you are trying to systematize and work you are
              trying to form out. Number 1 reason being is how cheap it is but
              there are some down falls, there are some negative things about
              virtual assistants. The first thing is you got to train them, you
              got to educate them, you got to go through 20 of them to find one
              good one that was up until I met Daven and started working with
              123Employee. The reason being is Daven is a genius at this
              business. He really filters the people he has, he really
              interviews them, he kind of puts people in categories so they know
              what they are good at so that way if you need a person for Social
              Media or you need a person for pay per click or you need a person
              for a call center or advertising, mortgage or whatever may be, he
              has people already good in that field and all these people speak
              English perfect, they are educated, they are professional, they
              give you reports, they are accountable and the best thing is you
              give them the task you don’t have to worry about so I love
              123Employee. I went through a lot, a lot of virtual assistants
              until I found them. I’ve got 1 girl over there, Lunny, she’s
              incredible. She basically does the work load of 15 people that we
              need to hire here so I appreciate Daven, love the company and if
              you’re thinking about it get on board. Get in as soon as possible.
              It will really help you become more efficient in your business.
              Thanks a lot Daven!
            </p>

              Hi, I’m Mindy Sylvester and I just want to tell you about my
              experience with 123Employee. I am a real estate agent and a
              professional speaker and I have so much work to do, I got so much
              going on and I really needed a little relief. I enjoy traveling
              and just having fun of being with my family and I seem to have
              gone bugged down with a lot of little details so I heard about
              123Employee and I hire my virtual assistant and it was one of the
              best things I’ve ever done. I’ve freed up so much time. My
              assistant is so wonderful. I got an interview with 2 different
              assistants and they were both wonderful but I picked one and my
              experience has been amazing! My virtual assistant is so attentive
              and so intelligent and so willing to do the things that I need to
              get done and she does them so quickly and definitely I have the
              best experience and I’ve just been able to live such a good life
              now because of it. I’ve actually took almost the whole month off
              last month but I’m still making money, I’m still getting deals
              closed and my internet presence has increased a lot, gotten a lot
              more leads. They just can do things that I can’t do especially
              with the internet so I highly recommend 123Employee. They can do a
              wide variety of things and your life will get a lot easier, it’s
              very affordable and it’s a really good investment. So, if you are
              looking to have a little bit more fun in life, free up some time
              so that you can focus your time and energy on the things that you
              love and income generating opportunities then definitely hire
              123Employee.

              Many people have been asking me – “Blake, how do you get it all
              done? How do you get so much done so fast? We are seeing the
              amounts of work that you are able to keep putting out. I
              constantly see you on Facebook, on Twitter, on MySpace, on Youtube
              and you’re out there in all your Social Networks” and the answer
              is I have a secret weapon in my back pocket and the secret weapon
              is called 123Employee. I’ve been using 123Employee now for a long
              time and it’s really just allowed me to go to the gym, to go out
              to the golf course, to spend time with my wife and my family and
              it’s just allowed me to get into a real comfortable position
              knowing that everything is going to be taken care of behind the
              scenes. All the time I am getting contact going – “Blake I just
              saw your new post you did on Facebook” and I’m like going “I
              haven’t even logged in to Facebook in 6 months”, so it’s just
              awesome and I invite you to enjoy this experience too. It’s one of
              my secret weapons. I would like to share all secret weapons and
              strategies that I’m using but 123Employee is one that will
              definitely sky rocket you to the next level.

              Hi, how are you doing today? My name is Justin Tillman and I just
              want to give you a quick testimonial about 123Employee. It’s an
              excellent service and the reason why it’s such good service is
              because being a young entrepreneur you kind of focus on the little
              tasks as well as the big tasks, split your time up you got 24
              hours in a day. So, after being able to leverage my time in
              actually working with 123Employee I am able to now have a virtual
              assistant who works with me and she’s able to take care of some of
              the other tasks that might have normally taken up all my time for
              the day which would have had me working all weekends. Now, I can
              spend it with my family and I really enjoyed my weekends. It’s an
              awesome service and I recommend that you definitely try it out and
              use it for yourself. Thank you.
            </p>

              My name is Bardi Toto and I’m doing a testimonial for 123Employee.
              They are phenomenal! Actually, my agent has built up my groups on
              Facebook and my fan pages. I have now over 2500 people on my
              groups and my fans. I could not have done it without 123Employee.
              They are awesome!

              Hey, this is Fabricio Cruz! I just want to take a quick moment to
              say how much I appreciate 123Employee. First off, I am an internet
              entrepreneur. I’ve been online for the last 15 years or so, for
              the most part it’d been kind of a one man show but things really
              started to explore once I got my first 123Employee. Basically, I
              had them doing my customer support via telephone, via email and
              the thing is I started out really really slow, I kind of regret
              that. I wish I would have started much faster because once I got
              rolling with them and once I understood what I was doing, you
              know, I just realized why wasn’t I doing this a long time ago. So,
              I just want to encourage anyone who is, maybe they feel like
              they’re limited on time or what not give 123Employee a try. The
              awesome thing about them is that they give you the opportunity to
              select your employee before you even pay them a penny. That was
              really comforting for me because you know the face and the voice
              of your business is really important because it represents you so
              you go to make sure that you find somebody who is adequate to
              represent that face and that voice so anyway just wanted to send
              that quick note that I highly recommend 123Employee, couldn’t live
              without them. I already got 2 of them and I’m going to be in the
              process getting my 3rd here very very soon. My business has more
              than doubled over the last year as a result of having my
              123Employee working for me. So, anyway this is Fabricio Cruz check
              them out and you won’t be sorry.
            </p>

              Hey, this is Fernando from Orlando and I’ve been using the
              123Employee VA for the past 11 months and what’s done for me is
              actually a lot of freedom. I’ve been able to work a lot less after
              living the four hour week back 3 years ago. I’ve been trying a lot
              of VA’s, firing a lot of VA’s and I’m very happy that I’ve been
              able to have Mildred from 123Employee in my team and she’s the one
              that actually deals with all the short sale paper work in take.
              She makes sure that lenders get everything from short sale
              processing. So she is busy, she takes care of everything. If she
              has any questions she texts me and I text her back, it’s just
              great! People can go to my site fernandobuyshouses.com and put in
              information of their homes and sell their homes. Mildred sometimes
              takes care of that and I actually have more time to do coaching.
              I’ve been buying houses for 7 years so coaching is something that
              I can do more of because I’m working less. So, thanks so much for
              the VA’s at 123Employee because I am able to work less and that’s
              the name of the game!
            </p>

              So, I’m Jason Web. I am the owner of Web IP Law Group. We’re an
              intellectual property law firm. We focus on patents, trademarks,
              copyrights, licensing, things like that. Also, I have a personal
              assistant with 123Employee. He’s been fantastic! He works a few
              hours a day for me. I know exactly when he starts working and when
              he finishes. Whenever he finishes work, he always tells me what he
              did which therefore confirms that what I’m assigning to do is
              accomplished and I love that. I have him doing several different
              tasks. Some of them are fairly complicated but I know that all I
              have to do is I just send him an email and I say do this, its
              super quick. What used to take me 15 to 20 minutes all of a sudden
              now it just takes a few seconds of my time and my time so valuable
              and I have to have that kind of help. So, I’m really appreciative
              of my employee and I definitely plan to use 123Employee for a long
              time.

              Hi my name is Frank Sousa and I am one of the code developers of
              traffic geyser and I wanna tell you we’ve been using a 123
              employee for last two years or so and I have to tell you that
              people that we deal with are absolutely wonderful. The work ethic
              s that they have is absolutely amazing. One of the problems I saw
              sometimes in the past with other Philippine workers was the fact
              they would lose their internet connection and we couldn’t depend
              on them, and that hasn’t happened not even once with 123 employee
              and I guess the reason for that because they have redundant
              systems their so they never go down. They’ve been very very
              helpful to me and I would absolutely recommend them to anybody.

              Hi my name is Heath Barnes and I used 123 employee for outsourcing
              of social media, marketing, helping me organize systems and
              strategies for our new business. Our VA is Honey Isong and we
              started using her in October and for example our facebook contacts
              have won from literally zero. I did not have a facebook page
              before that now I have, it’s a second week of December and I have
              over five hundred contacts. I would highly highly recommend 123
              employee and we will be hiring one to two more assistants this
              month. Thank you!
            </p>

              Hey Hollis Carter here and I wanna shoot a quick personal video to
              let you know about my experience with 123Employee. It’s been an
              amazing experience. Right now I have a live clients who are
              operating a new software system and I knew that one thing that
              would really get them to that next level would be working with
              123Employee so that they can actually have someone dependable,
              very reliable and trained and really educated so that they can
              outsource the things that they work and they don’t really gonna
              have time to do, so that now my clients are actually sees success
              guaranteed because these employees they are getting are trained,
              they have excellent management team behind them and I understand
              whats going on and I’m really impressed the way they’re clients
              see results very quickly there’s actually someone there that they
              can work with and depend on to get things done. So I give
              123Employe my full back and really enjoy it and I think if you are
              looking or trying to outsource some work or you have client of
              your own who need something to really help them to get the next
              level, the place that they can depend on to get outsourcing done I
              definitely recommend 123Employe!

              Hey everyone Robert Lord here with Direct Source Mania. I just
              want to take the minute to talk to you about Daven Michaels
              123Employee. Now I’ve been using his services for about nine (9)
              months now and believe it or not my facebook has exploded, my
              twitter has exploded. I can’t believe the amount of work and time
              and effort these guys put in to my accounts. I feel like they are
              my very own employees and I absolutely love them. 123Employee is a
              way to go! Robert Lord will see you later.

              Hey there this is Adam Kappel from atomic apps and I’ve known
              Daven Michaels from 123Employee for a while and I’ve just recently
              step into his outsourcing program and starting to give some task
              to a VA and at first I was a little bit hesitant to do it. I was
              always having a challenge of really delegating my task and giving
              it to somebody and not really knowing what was gonna happen and I
              have to say since starting with 123Employee it has been extreme
              line process to give them a task and they just get on it and they
              just figure out how they do it and they get it done for you and I
              completely eliminated my challenges and I completely eliminated my
              worrying of giving somebody else a task that I was so good at, so
              concern about giving it and soon as I gave it to them, they picked
              it up quickly, they learned it quickly and they get it done and
              they put it into a system that really really works . So thank you
              Daven, thank you everyone over at 123Employee, I’ve looking
              forward for a long standing relationship with you.
            </p>

              Hi everyone it’s Dustin Mathews from 7 figure speaking empire. I
              gotta tell you when I have Daven Michaels and 123Employee. Here’s
              a cool part, I have a virtual assistant right now that’s building
              my twitter followers and I don’t even like interact. They just do,
              I just gave them a task and they just go out and do my social
              media and they like blowing up my twitter followers and I think
              that’s the coolest thing and as an entrepreneur you wanna get to
              situations like that where things are already running. Without
              you, you have a hand with them that running without you and thing
              getting done and so I’m like a big fan and I just wanna tell the
              world about it and I think you should your own virtual assistant
              to help you with whatever it is, social media, do administrative
              task, take phone calls, make phone calls for you. And so if you
              get the opportunity to enroll in Daven’s system, 123Emplopyee and
              get your own virtual assistant I highly highly recommend it, it’s
              the first step of really getting your life back and it’s been
              completely awesome. So thank you once again.
            </p>

              year.<br /><br />
              And they developed our software, just amazing. So they have our
              highest regard and of course we highly recommend them. If you’re
              thinking about going into business with them or going to one of
              their seminars or events, or having them design software for you,
              or your back office support, or your marketing or SEO work; all I
              can say is these guys are the best of the best, and you know,
              thank you so much. I can’t thank you all enough.<br /><br />
              You were the first place I stopped that actually gave me solutions
              to some of the – well the hurdles that I had been challenged with
              in my business, in our business, you know I have multiple
              employees, and we’re a multi-million dollar business. And I
              couldn’t get to that next level, and I couldn’t have done it
              without you guys. I’ve been at a stall for years, and you made it
              happen! 123 Accelerator and 123 Employee.<br /><br />
              So from Aspen, Colorado, Todd Proffit, hey take these guys and
              take everything you can from them. I don’t mean take in a weird
              way, I mean you know anything they’re offering. So get out there
              and enjoy the ride with them, because they have a great one in
              store for you, depending on where you’re at and what you’re doing,
              I’m sure they can benefit you in one way, shape or form. So until
              next time, enjoy.

              Hello. My name is David Seagraves. I’m the founder of TrepMula.
              <br />
              <br />
              I’m a 123 Employee client and the reason why I chose them is
              because I thought - I had a lot of big ideas, but I knew that I
              couldn’t do all those ideas. And it was really clear to me that I
              needed help. It turned out that they were a really good decision.
              <br />
              <br />
              They gave me a week to ramp up with my Virtual Assistant, get our
              system straight, get myself organized, make my directives clear,
              and so as a result I’m getting my database built which has been
              going on now and I am really seeing some strong results. <br />
              <br />
              I have a product to sell, which to me is an important part of my
              business model. The database is an essential part of what I’m
              doing. They’ve made it extremely easy for me to accumulate the
              information I need and I have a lot of other projects I’ve got to
              do, a lot of marketing stuff, a lot of activities with support and
              with sales. They’re going to help me with all of those things.
              <br />
              <br />
              There isn’t anything I don’t think that they can’t do. So I plan
              to use them as much as I can for as long as I can. Highly
              recommended, 123 Employee is a great deal.
            </p>
