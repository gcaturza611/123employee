                  ever get along without them. 123 employee makes it so easy,
                  everyone needs to have a virtual assistant. i give them 5
                  stars. they do an amazing job and i highly recommend 123
                  employee as the answer to faster more productive growth. what
                  i found is that both worldwide travel plan and 123 employee

                  Hey this is Mike Evans here,and i just wanna share how much i
                  really enjoy of working with 123Employee, and the reason i
                  enjoying working with them cause they make me money, i have a
                  full time assistant he’s in Philippines and he works at the
                  same hour as he may come at the 12noon my time and leave at
                  9pm my time which is good for me cause i get up at 10AM, start
                  working around noon, but the most important thing in this guy
                  done for me is after i trained them is that he is now able to
                  come up with the ideas on his own to help me make money. i
                  mean that’s the most important thing. I’m in a very
                  complicated business, the internet marketing site, i have a
                  lot of links, and a lot of things that have in perfect order
                  for me to make money and first i was able to train them to do
                  that which is the most important thing, i was able to do that,
                  and for me quite on he’s never make a mistake except when i
                  gave him a wrong information.But on his in, he hasn’t make
                  mistake, that the first thing but he is able to take
                  initiative which is i asked him to do and make decision on his
                  own.And then, also offer suggestions to help me make more
                  money. So a lot of time he will think of things to do that i
                  haven’t taught for hand focus on and for me that’s the biggest
                  value that I’m getting from my personal assistant with
                  123Employee who’s in the Philippines. The last thing i wanna
                  say is you know, i was very skeptical first, i have tried
                  other virtual assistant from India and China and Philippines
                  as well, and you know i thought i could give them a lot of
                  cheaper and i would found it on my own.And you know what i
                  found is first of all these are the people they work from
                  their home when their computer is break they stop on their
                  work. With 123Employee that you can see they have their
                  office, with the generators, air condition and lights and you
                  know everyday that everything is gonna be working.And then you
                  know, he has a seat and a desk in a real office and because of
                  that I’ve got consistency from my experience with them.So
                  again. I’m a (?) you kind of person and i never thought i want
                  one or another assistant but now i found if i able double and
                  triple and actually quintuple the amount of income I’m making
                  because of my 123Employee assistant highly, highly recommend.
                  Thanks! I’m Mike Evans

                  Hi my name is Larry Steinhouse with Mall Stars Video
                  Productions Studios. My business is a combination of on-line
                  marketing and brick and mortar. Some of you may relate to the
                  day to day tasks of owning a business like this. One day, I
                  escaped my business and attended a seminar. While there, this
                  guy said.. During that seminar, Daven suggested all the
                  audience participants make a list of the things keeping them
                  from doing what was important, like acquiring new business.
                  Well I made my list. It included things like Facebook Fan page
                  maintenance, LinkedIn and twitter posts. I also added things
                  like e-mail marketing and campaigns. Article writing and so
                  many more things I keep doing that I really shouldn’t. Daven
                  surly convinced that I need to outsource this! But now I had
                  to deal with my own inhibitions of outsourcing. First of all,
                  I am here in the Philadelphia area and well the Philippines,
                  even though it sounds alike, is all the way.. Well somewhere
                  here! Many questions came to my mind like. What if there is
                  language barrier? Can I trust someone so far away? Can they
                  really do the tasks I need? And of course can I trust that
                  they will actually be working when they say they are? I
                  nervously called 123 Employee, and found that they actually
                  have an interview process. You can interview candidates to
                  make sure you have a good communication and trust level. .ok
                  you obviously know this is a testimonial and a success story,
                  so here is the bottom line. I am so amazed at the
                  professionalism of 123employee but even more important, Cassie
                  ias my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She really takes on
                  the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes suggestions
                  and researches ideas that will bring me business or traffic to
                  my website. The only thing she can’t do, is bring me coffee!
                  Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that we
                  expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
                  as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123employee, my
                  chances of making that happen will greatly increase! Oh and if
                  you have any questions or want to speak to me about this
                  reference, I will be glad to tell you about my experience.
                  Just contact with the information on the mall stars website
                  and Cassie… I mean, I will get back to you! :) Thanks Daven,
                  Thanks Cassie!

                  Hi I am Victoria Bowman and I have a PhD in Homeopathy in
                  natural medicine. My business is MyRealHealth.com and I love
                  123Employee. In fact Charlie my Virtual Assistant is amazing
                  and kudos to Richard who is my manager with 123Employee. The
                  things that have happened since I have started with them are
                  they have been submitting my articles to Ezine and they are
                  getting published. Also, we are doing an email marketing
                  program for one of the products that I represent and that is
                  going very well. They also have edited my YouTube videos so I
                  am all over YouTube and people are hitting it. They are
                  spreading the word and I am getting more business as well as
                  increasing my clout and my Pinterest presence on the web. So I
                  endorse 123Employee. Take a look you will be glad you did. Bye
                  now.

                  Hello my name is Sam Batier with Super-trainer.com. Super
                  trainer.com is a blog about showing personal trainers and
                  fitness professionals how to automate their business and not
                  to work so much in their business while on their business. As
                  we know being the personal trainer most of my life, it was
                  really bad because I had to get up at four o’clock in the
                  morning, Will train clients from five o’clock till noon and
                  then maybe get a little break from about 12 to 2 or 3 o’clock
                  and you have to go back, repeat from 4 to 8- 9 o’clock and I’d
                  never had any life. I was making an ok money but I had no
                  life, no time to meet someone special, no time to have a
                  social life, no time to do laundering. Nothing! So over years
                  I systematized my own dreams called fitconcepts.com and I
                  systematized my other bootcamp businesses. I have bootcamps
                  right now. I have six bootcamps in California , I have six
                  bootcamps in Chicago so I automate those business and I barely
                  ever dare. So what I’m now I’m teaching other fitness
                  professionals how to automate their business and be able to
                  have a life. I mean, I don’t care how much money out there you
                  making but if you don’t have a life it’s really not worth it.
                  Now today I have a beautiful wife, I have a beautiful children
                  and I can probably work wherever I want and I couldn’t done
                  that without having a team of people that I can rely on to and
                  what ‘i mean by that is somebody I can be able to call and be
                  able to get a job done and job done correctly and a job done
                  for a reasonable price. So that’s why I rely on 123Employee
                  because 123Employee has a virtual assistants that are
                  professional, that speak the language, that are supervised and
                  somebody I can actually call. A lot of times we have a virtual
                  assistants before I couldn’t get a hold of them, I didn’t know
                  if they are working my project or not I couldn’t rely the
                  message to them and there was a language barrier but
                  123Employee they have taken the virtual assistant industry to
                  a whole new level and it’s just a breath of fresh air that I
                  can totally rely on to someone and know that the job gets done
                  and they guarantee it. This is the cool thing about it, if
                  something didn’t work they guarantee their job and they always
                  on top of it. Great service! I cannot have been here at this
                  event without 123Employee. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

                  Hey this is Mike Crow with the Millionaire inspector
                  community. I also coach other coaches that are trying to
                  create their own next program. You can go out to
                  coachblueprint.com if you would like to get a free report on
                  that. But that’s not what I really wanna here for. I really
                  want you to know one of the secrets I used to help grow my
                  coaching business. Now currently I’m using 123Employee. And I
                  have a young lady by the name Sheila and she just does
                  incredible job. She’s helping us do list building, she’s
                  helping us set meet up groups, and she’s helping us make sure
                  all kinds of information fully enforced out there in the
                  internet. Now I’m gonna tell you another secret, I have ten
                  people that worked for me and I can touch any single day. I
                  didn’t hire the virtual assistant for me, I hired it for my
                  top two people and then I actually said: hey you know what I
                  said we’ve gonna have get rid of these person, I don’t think
                  they are doing that much force and both of them almost quit on
                  me because they said if you do that we gotta do all her work
                  and we don’t wanna do that. We wanna make sure that you keep
                  her. So you know what she ain’t goin anywhere anytime soon.
                  123Employee has been taken really good care of my people which
                  mean my people taken really good care of me, which means more
                  business. Daven thank you. 123Employee thank you so much
                  guys!!!

                  income. Now one of the things that’s been great is it’s freed
                  me up from having to do all the tasks that I just simply just
                  don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on the IGAs
                  or the income generating activities in my business. So if you
                  want to make a difference in your business I highly recommend
                  you check them out. You go to 123Employee.com, find out what
                  they’re about, give LJ a call and see what they can do for
                  you. Because I can tell you, I would not be where I’m at in my
                  business and my life today if it wasn’t for 123 Employee. So
                  once again, this is Roy Meyer and I high recommend you give
                  them a call.

                  Hey guys. This is Tracy Walker with keepallthecash.com and
                  before getting plugged into 123Employee, I was probably like a
                  lot of entrepreneurs where I had so many different ideas and
                  so many different things going on in my business that I just
                  couldn’t implement them all. So I decided to take a chance,
                  get started with 123Employee, get my own VA and what she does
                  for me is she does all of my marketing. If I say to her
                  listen, I need you to post a blog post for me, she’ll post it.
                  If I ask her to do any keyword research for me, she does that.
                  She does a lot of my syndication, meaning that she posts on
                  Facebook for me, she posts on Pinterest for me, she does my
                  Instagram work for me. She does my articles and doing
                  back-linking and all these wonderful things and she uploads my
                  videos to my YouTube channel. So if you’re ready to outsource
                  your business and actually get to back to living your life and
                  having fun in your business, I highly recommend you get
                  plugged into 123Employee, Daven will take are of you.

                  Hi, I’m Marbeth Dunn, yourjoyjourney.com. And I’m so happy
                  today to tell you about Daven Michaels 123Employee. I was a
                  little reticent at the beginning to work with a VA, I didn’t
                  quite understand how it was going to be but I love my VA. He
                  audits my audios; I have a radio show, radio show host of the
                  Great Metamorphosis on the Law of Attraction radio network. He
                  edits my audios, he’s fantastic. And he also posts on social
                  media, he posts my blogs and he posts them all over social
                  media for me, because you know as a busy entrepreneur you
                  don’t have time to do all this yourself. So Daven’s people
                  have saved my life, made me have more time in the day to play.
                  Thank you, Daven.

                  Hi my name is Gail Kinsbury and I worked with speakers,
                  trainers, authors all over the world and I help them get on
                  the stages, I’m producing events I travel a tone. I’m a single
                  mom with three kids and a very very busy life. I decided to go
                  ahead and used an employee from Daven Michaels with
                  123Employee and what we’ve done with that is. a time that is
                  given me back in my life and to be able to spend with my kids.
                  I can focus on my clients for just having her do a little bit
                  of things like research foe an event, getting links out of my
                  affiliate account, getting things posted, creating a twitter
                  profile for me that I never had time to even bother with and
                  where how to do it, how to put new picture on a twitter
                  page,Clueless!?! She got it done in less than two hours and
                  it’s just been a really great seamless experience working with
                  123Employee. if you have the opportunity, I suggest you do it
                  too!.

                  I now a working consultants I wanted to share to you my
                  experience with my VA with 123Employee. Since I have used my
                  VA she has been phenomenal, she ha handled all of my social
                  media marketing my email marketing even taken my inbound phone
                  calls and she is doing an amazing job, my staff loves her,
                  she’s easy to work with, she’s a hard worker. One great
                  experience is I was at the seminar and I checked my email and
                  in a few hours i had a hundred and forty three twitter
                  followers just following my emails.SO for those that are small
                  business owners and entrepreneurs I recommend 123Employee,
                  they would just take all paper works headache away. They are
                  willing to do I mean they are just at your service, you give
                  them everything you need and they will take care the rest so I
                  highly recommend 123Employee.

                  Hey Collin Daymude here. I just speak all over the world and
                  I’m an entrepreneur, I’ve written four books, I’m busy
                  traveling all of the time. So to get stuff done, I went to
                  Daven and said I don’t know what your VA’s can do but I just
                  keep here and about them so please give me the loads out. He
                  sent me this long PDF file of everything his VA can do.
                  Virtual assistants there it. I mean you just have to get one.
                  so here’s the problem I had. I actually had come up with new
                  ideas and ask people what can my VA do for me because she gets
                  stuff done in a day,amazing! She took seven thousand gmail
                  contact and sort them into folders it was amazing! Everyday
                  she checks my inbox, filters things, she sort them, she gets
                  rid of the junk she took my PDF copies of all my expenses for
                  the last year bank statement, she categorize all of them.
                  Amazing! she saves my so much time which is unbelievable. I
                  have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s done with the
                  project, she says Collin what else do you have for me, I mean
                  when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
                  somebody. So I actually have to ask people what can I have my
                  VA do today, because i have to be creative, i had to go back
                  to Daven long list of stuff to figure out oh! she can do this,
                  she can do that and then I give her another project plus the
                  ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta get 123Employee, check it
                  out, call Daven, It will be the thing you’ve ever done.

                  Hi I’m Alka Dalal and I’m from Santa Monica California. Well I
                  have something to give, to contribute to because I’m a
                  123employee client and not just client I’m client for just 1
                  full year. I’ve used them and Ive been very very happy with
                  them and the reason I say that because it freed lot of my time
                  off and this is what I came up with my book, ” Creative
                  Genius: Tips to Unleash yours. This is a great book, it’s on
                  Amazon.com and the reason I could right this book and I’m also
                  writing many other books, my second book is coming up soon the
                  reason is that I’m using 123Employee. They’re very wonderful
                  to me, they do all my social networking, my articles posting
                  and so many things they do for me that it frees my time off
                  and I do what I’m good at like to train leaders in creativity
                  and internet marketing so I do lots of those things for
                  myself. I write books, and I go around and talk to people
                  network so I can do so many otter things where I have my
                  123Employee doing all the works for me in the back end in the
                  office and the are very very easy to deal with, they speak
                  excellent English, they write excellent English and I am
                  really very very happy, so go for it people, 123Employee!

                  Hi, this is Dr. Marc Kossman of Personal Success Marketing and
                  I have high words of praise for 123Employee and Daven
                  Michaels. Our personal assistant John is the secret ingredient
                  that allowed us to take our books fly somewhere on the rank of
                  3 Million on Amazon.com to a number 1 bestseller in our
                  category. There are just so many things that you can outsource
                  as an author and get the job done and so you got to check out
                  123Employee, we very highly recommend it did the job for us.
                  Right, it was like a breath of fresh air and what did he do
                  for us? He cleared the sight didn’t he? He just wiped it all
                  gone, it’s all gone so that we can focus on getting our book
                  done. We got the book, we got it done and now we have John.

                  I am Anushka Drescher from Burkley, California and 2 weeks ago
                  I started working with 123Employee. I got a wonderful
                  assistant named Maria and she has helped me so much just in
                  the last 2 weeks. Some of the examples the way she’s helped me
                  is that she has created a mind map for my whole business. All
                  of the things that I need to do, she’s put them on a visual
                  map online. She has helped build a database of customers.
                  Right now I’m here at Super Teaching at CEO Space, I take my
                  electronic notes everyday, I highlight the parts that are
                  action items, I email her my notes everyday and she creates
                  another visual mind map of all the actions I’ve said I need to
                  take. When I get home I know exactly what I need to do. Maria
                  has been amazing, she’s always ready to please, she’s always
                  friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful that I
                  came across her and she’s going to save me a lot of time and
                  money. She’s going to be preparing a newsletter for me that I
                  get paid for $500 to do it once a month. It’ll take her about
                  2 hours to do it once I train her and I will pay for her
                  entire salary for the whole month. I love 123Employee!

                  Hey everybody, Casey Eberhart coming to you from sunny Los
                  Angeles, California. I hope you are having as awesome of a day
                  as I am. I just wanted to take a quick minute to give a quick
                  shout out to the guys and gals over at 123Employee.com. I got
                  to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
                  outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound
                  calls and our social media we just had an opposite ran
                  completely disorganized and messy. About 6 months ago, just to
                  give you a quick example, 6 months ago my Twitter account had
                  a couple of thousand followers as of today I’m in about 20,
                  000. You can check that out, very easy for you to go check
                  out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure that out all on
                  your own and I got to tell you the outsourced employees over
                  there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get done what they
                  say they’re going to do in less time that I could ever find
                  somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
                  123Employee to take care of all of your tasks. Then you look
                  around and may not be the best at or you may not like to do
                  them, these guys can do them at a rate that’s unmatchable,
                  unbeatable and you will not get better service. So check out
                  123Employee.com. Again Caset Eberhart coming to you from Los
                  Angeles.

                  Hello my name is Chris Carter I’m a local niche marketer and
                  online marketer. We used 123Employee for our outbound sales
                  for a lot of product and services and things we do inside of
                  our business that it saves me a tone of time. In fact one of
                  the gentlemen Luijey was fantastic and helping us builds the
                  list and put things together. Folks when you wanna do the
                  things or half things done that you don’t need to do that
                  blowing to pay crater; you know what? You just might not know
                  how to do and you know you need to get it done make sure you
                  join 123Employee and have it done for you. You deserve the

                  Hi, Darius Askaripour here from the Innovative Investors
                  wanting to make a real quick video for my good friend Daven
                  Michaels. Daven owns a company called 123Employee and if
                  you’re not aware of getting virtual assistants you need to get
                  on it and get on it fast. You know, virtual assistants are
                  intricate part to any business but they really help you bridge
                  the gap of needing help, of getting employees, of training
                  people because we know good and well that employees are not
                  cheap, usually they are not. We know that in turn sometimes
                  they are a little iffy, they are a little shaky but having a
                  virtual assistant is a necessary component to any business
                  that you are trying to systematize and work you are trying to
                  form out. Number 1 reason being is how cheap it is but there
                  are some down falls, there are some negative things about
                  virtual assistants. The first thing is you got to train them,
                  you got to educate them, you got to go through 20 of them to
                  find one good one that was up until I met Daven and started
                  working with 123Employee. The reason being is Daven is a
                  genius at this business. He really filters the people he has,
                  he really interviews them, he kind of puts people in
                  categories so they know what they are good at so that way if
                  you need a person for Social Media or you need a person for
                  pay per click or you need a person for a call center or
                  advertising, mortgage or whatever may be, he has people
                  already good in that field and all these people speak English
                  perfect, they are educated, they are professional, they give
                  you reports, they are accountable and the best thing is you
                  give them the task you don’t have to worry about so I love
                  123Employee. I went through a lot, a lot of virtual assistants
                  until I found them. I’ve got 1 girl over there, Lunny, she’s
                  incredible. She basically does the work load of 15 people that
                  we need to hire here so I appreciate Daven, love the company
                  and if you’re thinking about it get on board. Get in as soon
                  as possible. It will really help you become more efficient in
                  your business. Thanks a lot Daven!

                  Hi, I’m Mindy Sylvester and I just want to tell you about my
                  experience with 123Employee. I am a real estate agent and a
                  professional speaker and I have so much work to do, I got so
                  much going on and I really needed a little relief. I enjoy
                  traveling and just having fun of being with my family and I
                  seem to have gone bugged down with a lot of little details so
                  I heard about 123Employee and I hire my virtual assistant and
                  it was one of the best things I’ve ever done. I’ve freed up so
                  much time. My assistant is so wonderful. I got an interview
                  with 2 different assistants and they were both wonderful but I
                  picked one and my experience has been amazing! My virtual
                  assistant is so attentive and so intelligent and so willing to
                  do the things that I need to get done and she does them so
                  quickly and definitely I have the best experience and I’ve
                  just been able to live such a good life now because of it.
                  I’ve actually took almost the whole month off last month but
                  I’m still making money, I’m still getting deals closed and my
                  internet presence has increased a lot, gotten a lot more
                  leads. They just can do things that I can’t do especially with
                  the internet so I highly recommend 123Employee. They can do a
                  wide variety of things and your life will get a lot easier,
                  it’s very affordable and it’s a really good investment. So, if
                  you are looking to have a little bit more fun in life, free up
                  some time so that you can focus your time and energy on the
                  things that you love and income generating opportunities then
                  definitely hire 123Employee.

                  all done? How do you get so much done so fast? We are seeing
                  the amounts of work that you are able to keep putting out. I
                  constantly see you on Facebook, on Twitter, on MySpace, on
                  Youtube and you’re out there in all your Social Networks” and
                  the answer is I have a secret weapon in my back pocket and the
                  secret weapon is called 123Employee. I’ve been using
                  123Employee now for a long time and it’s really just allowed
                  me to go to the gym, to go out to the golf course, to spend
                  time with my wife and my family and it’s just allowed me to
                  get into a real comfortable position knowing that everything
                  is going to be taken care of behind the scenes. All the time I
                  am getting contact going – “Blake I just saw your new post you
                  did on Facebook” and I’m like going “I haven’t even logged in
                  to Facebook in 6 months”, so it’s just awesome and I invite
                  you to enjoy this experience too. It’s one of my secret
                  weapons. I would like to share all secret weapons and
                  strategies that I’m using but 123Employee is one that will
                  definitely sky rocket you to the next level.

                  Hi, how are you doing today? My name is Justin Tillman and I
                  just want to give you a quick testimonial about 123Employee.
                  It’s an excellent service and the reason why it’s such good
                  service is because being a young entrepreneur you kind of
                  focus on the little tasks as well as the big tasks, split your
                  time up you got 24 hours in a day. So, after being able to
                  leverage my time in actually working with 123Employee I am
                  able to now have a virtual assistant who works with me and
                  she’s able to take care of some of the other tasks that might
                  have normally taken up all my time for the day which would
                  have had me working all weekends. Now, I can spend it with my
                  family and I really enjoyed my weekends. It’s an awesome
                  service and I recommend that you definitely try it out and use
                  it for yourself. Thank you.

                  Hey, this is Fabricio Cruz! I just want to take a quick moment
                  to say how much I appreciate 123Employee. First off, I am an
                  internet entrepreneur. I’ve been online for the last 15 years
                  or so, for the most part it’d been kind of a one man show but
                  things really started to explore once I got my first
                  123Employee. Basically, I had them doing my customer support
                  via telephone, via email and the thing is I started out really
                  really slow, I kind of regret that. I wish I would have
                  started much faster because once I got rolling with them and
                  once I understood what I was doing, you know, I just realized
                  why wasn’t I doing this a long time ago. So, I just want to
                  encourage anyone who is, maybe they feel like they’re limited
                  on time or what not give 123Employee a try. The awesome thing
                  about them is that they give you the opportunity to select
                  your employee before you even pay them a penny. That was
                  really comforting for me because you know the face and the
                  voice of your business is really important because it
                  represents you so you go to make sure that you find somebody
                  who is adequate to represent that face and that voice so
                  anyway just wanted to send that quick note that I highly
                  recommend 123Employee, couldn’t live without them. I already
                  got 2 of them and I’m going to be in the process getting my
                  3rd here very very soon. My business has more than doubled
                  over the last year as a result of having my 123Employee
                  working for me. So, anyway this is Fabricio Cruz check them
                  out and you won’t be sorry.

                  Hey, this is Fernando from Orlando and I’ve been using the
                  123Employee VA for the past 11 months and what’s done for me
                  is actually a lot of freedom. I’ve been able to work a lot
                  less after living the four hour week back 3 years ago. I’ve
                  been trying a lot of VA’s, firing a lot of VA’s and I’m very
                  happy that I’ve been able to have Mildred from 123Employee in
                  my team and she’s the one that actually deals with all the
                  short sale paper work in take. She makes sure that lenders get
                  everything from short sale processing. So she is busy, she
                  takes care of everything. If she has any questions she texts
                  me and I text her back, it’s just great! People can go to my
                  site fernandobuyshouses.com and put in information of their
                  homes and sell their homes. Mildred sometimes takes care of
                  that and I actually have more time to do coaching. I’ve been
                  buying houses for 7 years so coaching is something that I can
                  do more of because I’m working less. So, thanks so much for
                  the VA’s at 123Employee because I am able to work less and
                  that’s the name of the game!

                  So, I’m Jason Web. I am the owner of Web IP Law Group. We’re
                  an intellectual property law firm. We focus on patents,
                  trademarks, copyrights, licensing, things like that. Also, I
                  have a personal assistant with 123Employee. He’s been
                  fantastic! He works a few hours a day for me. I know exactly
                  when he starts working and when he finishes. Whenever he
                  finishes work, he always tells me what he did which therefore
                  confirms that what I’m assigning to do is accomplished and I
                  love that. I have him doing several different tasks. Some of
                  them are fairly complicated but I know that all I have to do
                  is I just send him an email and I say do this, its super
                  quick. What used to take me 15 to 20 minutes all of a sudden
                  now it just takes a few seconds of my time and my time so
                  valuable and I have to have that kind of help. So, I’m really
                  appreciative of my employee and I definitely plan to use
                  123Employee for a long time.

                  Hi my name is Frank Sousa and I am one of the code developers
                  of traffic geyser and I wanna tell you we’ve been using a 123
                  employee for last two years or so and I have to tell you that
                  people that we deal with are absolutely wonderful. The work
                  ethic s that they have is absolutely amazing. One of the
                  problems I saw sometimes in the past with other Philippine
                  workers was the fact they would lose their internet connection
                  and we couldn’t depend on them, and that hasn’t happened not
                  even once with 123 employee and I guess the reason for that
                  because they have redundant systems their so they never go
                  down. They’ve been very very helpful to me and I would
                  absolutely recommend them to anybody.

                  Hey guys it’s Larry Goins how are you ‘doing? I gotta tell
                  you, you have got to have a VA, a virtual assistants and if
                  you gonna get a VA to do everything that you need to do from
                  managing your social media, your social network, your
                  facebook, your twitter account, posting videos, submitting
                  articles and answering your emails, oh my God I used to spend
                  half a day answering my email. If you gonna get a VA you need
                  to use 123 employee. These guys were the best; they already
                  trained to work with business owners, entrepreneurs and real
                  estate investors. So take it from me, Larry Goins work with

                  Hi my name is Heath Barnes and I used 123 employee for
                  outsourcing of social media, marketing, helping me organize
                  systems and strategies for our new business. Our VA is Honey
                  Isong and we started using her in October and for example our
                  facebook contacts have won from literally zero. I did not have
                  a facebook page before that now I have, it’s a second week of
                  December and I have over five hundred contacts. I would highly
                  highly recommend 123 employee and we will be hiring one to two
                  more assistants this month. Thank you!

                  Hey Hollis Carter here and I wanna shoot a quick personal
                  video to let you know about my experience with 123Employee.
                  It’s been an amazing experience. Right now I have a live
                  clients who are operating a new software system and I knew
                  that one thing that would really get them to that next level
                  would be working with 123Employee so that they can actually
                  have someone dependable, very reliable and trained and really
                  educated so that they can outsource the things that they work
                  and they don’t really gonna have time to do, so that now my
                  clients are actually sees success guaranteed because these
                  employees they are getting are trained, they have excellent
                  management team behind them and I understand whats going on
                  and I’m really impressed the way they’re clients see results
                  very quickly there’s actually someone there that they can work
                  with and depend on to get things done. So I give 123Employe my
                  full back and really enjoy it and I think if you are looking
                  or trying to outsource some work or you have client of your
                  own who need something to really help them to get the next
                  level, the place that they can depend on to get outsourcing
                  done I definitely recommend 123Employe!

                  123Employee. Now I’ve been using his services for about nine
                  (9) months now and believe it or not my facebook has exploded,
                  my twitter has exploded. I can’t believe the amount of work
                  and time and effort these guys put in to my accounts. I feel
                  like they are my very own employees and I absolutely love
                  them. 123Employee is a way to go! Robert Lord will see you

                  Hey there this is Adam Kappel from atomic apps and I’ve known
                  Daven Michaels from 123Employee for a while and I’ve just
                  recently step into his outsourcing program and starting to
                  give some task to a VA and at first I was a little bit
                  hesitant to do it. I was always having a challenge of really
                  delegating my task and giving it to somebody and not really
                  knowing what was gonna happen and I have to say since starting
                  with 123Employee it has been extreme line process to give them
                  a task and they just get on it and they just figure out how
                  they do it and they get it done for you and I completely
                  eliminated my challenges and I completely eliminated my
                  worrying of giving somebody else a task that I was so good at,
                  so concern about giving it and soon as I gave it to them, they
                  picked it up quickly, they learned it quickly and they get it
                  done and they put it into a system that really really works .
                  So thank you Daven, thank you everyone over at 123Employee,
                  I’ve looking forward for a long standing relationship with
                  you.

                  Hi everyone it’s Dustin Mathews from 7 figure speaking empire.
                  I gotta tell you when I have Daven Michaels and 123Employee.
                  Here’s a cool part, I have a virtual assistant right now
                  that’s building my twitter followers and I don’t even like
                  interact. They just do, I just gave them a task and they just
                  go out and do my social media and they like blowing up my
                  twitter followers and I think that’s the coolest thing and as
                  an entrepreneur you wanna get to situations like that where
                  things are already running. Without you, you have a hand with
                  them that running without you and thing getting done and so
                  I’m like a big fan and I just wanna tell the world about it
                  and I think you should your own virtual assistant to help you
                  with whatever it is, social media, do administrative task,
                  take phone calls, make phone calls for you. And so if you get
                  the opportunity to enroll in Daven’s system, 123Emplopyee and
                  get your own virtual assistant I highly highly recommend it,
                  it’s the first step of really getting your life back and it’s
                  been completely awesome. So thank you once again.

                  Okay. Well, Todd Proffit here with Proffware and Proffit
                  Development.com. And you know I went to Daven and Beejal’s
                  Beyond Business Live here, I guess kind of close to a year
                  ago. I’ve been working with of 123 Accelerator and 123
                  Employee here for about a year. And they developed our
                  software, just amazing. So they have our highest regard and of
                  course we highly recommend them. If you’re thinking about
                  going into business with them or going to one of their
                  seminars or events, or having them design software for you, or
                  your back office support, or your marketing or SEO work; all I
                  can say is these guys are the best of the best, and you know,
                  thank you so much. I can’t thank you all enough. You were the
                  first place I stopped that actually gave me solutions to some
                  of the – well the hurdles that I had been challenged with in
                  my business, in our business, you know I have multiple
                  employees, and we’re a multi-million dollar business. And I
                  couldn’t get to that next level, and I couldn’t have done it
                  without you guys. I’ve been at a stall for years, and you made
                  it happen! 123 Accelerator and 123 Employee. So from Aspen,
                  Colorado, Todd Proffit, hey take these guys and take
                  everything you can from them. I don’t mean take in a weird
                  way, I mean you know anything they’re offering. So get out
                  there and enjoy the ride with them, because they have a great
                  one in store for you, depending on where you’re at and what
                  you’re doing, I’m sure they can benefit you in one way, shape
                  or form. So until next time, enjoy.

                  Hello. My name is David Seagraves. I’m the founder of
                  TrepMula. I’m a 123 Employee client and the reason why I chose
                  them is because I thought - I had a lot of big ideas, but I
                  knew that I couldn’t do all those ideas. And it was really
                  clear to me that I needed help. It turned out that they were a
                  really good decision. They gave me a week to ramp up with my
                  Virtual Assistant, get our system straight, get myself
                  organized, make my directives clear, and so as a result I’m
                  getting my database built which has been going on now and I am
                  really seeing some strong results. I have a product to sell,
                  which to me is an important part of my business model. The
                  database is an essential part of what I’m doing. They’ve made
                  it extremely easy for me to accumulate the information I need
                  and I have a lot of other projects I’ve got to do, a lot of
                  marketing stuff, a lot of activities with support and with
                  sales. They’re going to help me with all of those things.
                  There isn’t anything I don’t think that they can’t do. So I
                  plan to use them as much as I can for as long as I can. Highly
                  recommended, 123 Employee is a great deal.
