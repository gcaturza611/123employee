          <h2>Outsourcing The Future</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Evaluating the past is necessary in order to determine the future as
          we could find useful and salvageable models. The modern hospital is
          such a model for outsourcing.
          <br /><br />
          Early in the days, hospitals barely had effective medicines and
          operations were catastrophic. Between the 19th and the 20th century,
          hospitals had a way better chance of improving health as medicine
          became “scientific”. As health alongside the hospitals in developed
          countries, sicknesses like tuberculosis, cholera began to receive less
          focus as hospitals concentrated on more challenging issues like
          cancer, genetic research and heart disease.
          <br /><br />
          To meet up with the new challenges, hospitals needed advanced and
          sophisticated equipment’s. It was no longer enough to have lots of
          beds and test tubes in labs. Although medical practitioners were
          talented, they lacked the required training to utilize and maintain
          these modern equipment’s. Hence, outsourcing became very important.
          <br /><br />
          Now, a network of organizations such as insurance groups,
          governmentorganisa?ons, education, specialty clinics as well as the
          recent data outsourcers(who make use of tools like IBM Watson) work
          together to treat patients.
          <br /><br />
          Let us analyze how the transformation of hospitals foretell the
          evolution of outsourcing.
          <br /><br />
          Outsourcing of the last generation: In nations like China and India,
          outsourcing used to be induced by lower wages. Businesses hired more
          people offshore than they had onshore. However, offshore companies had
          less equipment and were less automated. The mode of work had to
          change, but the goals of all parties were met. The offshore economy
          had to spend money purchasing equipment which raised operational cost
          and slowed down implementation.
          <br /><br />
          Size: While Europe and the United States already had big factories
          handling car and airplane production, outsourcing completely scaled
          when it was moved to China. Over the past 10 years, China built over
          500 new cites in order to accommodate workers that would be needed by
          new industries. This scaling of operations created a new type of
          outsourcing. For instance, outsourcing industries that assemble
          electronic parts.
          <br /><br />
          Increased reliability: In the early days of outsourcing, it was
          perceived as unreliable. Some projects like “Lift and Shift” failed.
          With the scaling of outsourcing at the beginning of the 21st century,
          about 50% of outsourcing was a success. Those who failed lacked
          necessary skills, or skipped some steps. Outsourcing has now become
          more successful generally, especially when creditable outsourcing
          sites are engaged.
          <br /><br />
          Computer support: Large industries used to run their own IT
          department, right now the likes of Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web
          Services (AWS) handle IT responsibilities of plenty enterprises. For
          small businesses in America, marketplaces like Amazon have literarily
          snapped up warehousing and distribution.
          <br /><br />
          Advancement in automation and robot invention via technology are
          revolutionizing manufacturing models, which is leading to more
          business activities being outsourced, hence the need for
          multi-dimensional outsourcing.
          <br /><br />

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
