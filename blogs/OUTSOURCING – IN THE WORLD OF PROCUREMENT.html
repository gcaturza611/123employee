          <h2>OUTSOURCING IN THE WORLD OF PROCUREMENT</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          In the world of Outsourcing, the various classes of projects that can
          be outsourced are numerous. The company holds the discretion as to the
          projects to outsource, and the projects to keep in-house. Companies
          outsource Procurement as a service, to third party in a bid to take
          that load off them, and save cost.
          <br /><br />
          Projects like Procurement could be a sensitive aspect in most
          organizations. The concerns of handling procurement, whether in-house
          or outsourced, usually border around cutting costs/ unnecessary
          expenditure on the company’s needs, as they are more about finding out
          ways of investing on things that will yield direct income to the
          organization.
          <br /><br />
          It is important that you are able to ascertain whether or not you are
          hitting your organization’s targets with you Procurement Outsourcing
          partnership. We notice that many companies do not have this testimony,
          and more often than not, run at a loss or are just not achieving their
          expectations or goals by outsourcing their procurement.
          <br /><br />
          Don’t only think “save money”; also think – can I reinvest the monies
          saved as a result of outsourcing my procurement needs?
          <br /><br />
          In the apprehensions of the risks of engaging procurement firms to
          handle your procurement needs, keep in mind that no business is
          without risks. Sudden unforeseen matters can creep up on the smoothest
          sails, and sometimes, the Innovations of the crew are just what they
          need to stay afloat. Outsourcing firms are usually that crew that work
          through unforeseen challenges with their expertise and methods
          “outside the book”, to make sure they deliver to in record time, and
          meeting the expectations of their clients.
          <br /><br />
          Because procurements outsourcing entail some multi-reliance and
          optioning, there can be a whole lot of damage control when it comes to
          the relationships between the distributors or sellers and the clients
          who happen to be the procurement outsourcing firms, and if not – the
          company directly in need of the items. In such cases of dealing
          directly with suppliers, companies are faced with monotonous delivery,
          or sometimes disappointments that could lead to a major strain in the
          seller and buyer relationship. Time taken in searching for new
          (equally or more reliable) options may cause a stalling, and in some
          cases, a major setback in company operations. That is where the role
          of a procurement outsourcing firm comes in handy, where the setbacks
          one or two suppliers would have caused a company, are prevented.
          <br /><br />
          The fears of diversion of clients’ patronage should not be a challenge
          where this is properly managed by the organization.
          <br /><br />
          Outsourcing firms are usually your “invisible partners” that work
          underground in making the whole wheel turn.

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              my notes everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all
              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
