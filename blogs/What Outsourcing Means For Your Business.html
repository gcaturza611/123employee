          <h2>What Outsourcing Means For Your Business</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Companies can outsource any position whatsoever. Still, today, we see
          companies using it for non-fundamental roles, those whose function is
          to provide support to the central infrastructure of the company or aid
          in the day-to-day operations of the company. Due to some
          misunderstandings all around, outsourcing can sometimes be a rather
          polarizing term. Employees tend to see it as a threat to their job
          while employers think that the whole process of outsourcing can be
          more trouble than it’s worth. Under the wrong circumstances, both of
          these things can definitely be true. If however, the outsourcing
          process is handled properly, there’s no reason for the process to be a
          problematic one.
          <br /><br />
          First of all, in addressing the employee issue, there’s no reason for
          your business to incur the expense of buying all of the necessary
          equipment and hiring the personnel to run a proper IT department in
          the first place if IT is not what your business does. These are
          expenses that your business has no need to carry the burden of to
          begin with, so jobs that should exist should not be jobs that are in
          danger. Minimizing the costs of operation for your business in an area
          such as this allows your business to make more money and, if
          necessary, allows your business the freedom to create other, more
          essential, positions since funds that would have been eaten up by
          another department have been freed up.
          <br /><br />
          Concerning the difficulty of the outsourcing process, there’s no
          reason that transition should be a very difficult one. There are
          entire companies out there that base their operation on providing
          outsourced services. The outsourcing process can be as simple as
          identifying one of these companies that best meets your needs, making
          sure that the company is reliable and trustworthy, and letting the
          deal go forward naturally from there. These companies already have the
          overhead and other necessary equipment to house and provide the
          relevant services and they have already hired the appropriate
          personnel to staff these operations. There is no need for you or your
          business to incur the time consuming, expensive process of building
          and acquiring all of the necessary physical property and to go through
          the tedious work of hiring the appropriate workers to staff the
          operation.
          <br /><br />
          It can be as simple as doing an internet search, investigating the
          returned results to make sure that they are valid, and placing an
          order; that is all it takes to outsource certain aspects of your
          business. This saves you costs on expenses and it saves you time, thus
          keeping you from misspending some very valuable resources that could
          be working harder for you in other areas of your business.
          <br /><br />
          This article will tell you what is outsourcing and how it helps your
          business, also business areas you can outsource, types of outsourcing,
          and a few more tips before you take a plunge into the industry.

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              everyday, I highlight the parts that are action items, I email her
              my notes everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all
              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful
              that I came across her and she’s going to save me a lot of time
              and money.

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
