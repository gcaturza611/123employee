          <h2>If You’re Ready To Outsource: Here’s What You Can Outsource</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Some businesses can handle normal daily activities but need outside
          help to take on new projects that don’t justify another employee.
          Other businesses are just struggling to manage day-to-day business.
          Still others are seeking ways to get more done or cut expenses in this
          challenging economy.
          <br /><br />
          <i
            >There are many valid reasons to consider outsourcing, but here are
            some of the most compelling.</i
          ><br /><br />
          <li>
            Focus on core business activities. For many businesses, the primary
            motivation to outsource is that it frees owners, managers and
            employees to spend their time on income generating activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve opportunities for growth. Frequently opportunities for
            company growth and a desire to expand business operations exist, but
            resources to make it happen are lacking.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increase efficiency and effectiveness. In many cases, outsourcing
            allows access to expert talent. Outsource service firms can offer
            innovative approaches, the latest technology, and creative,
            cutting-edge solutions that otherwise aren’t available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve your bottom line by decreasing your expenses. A skilled
            contractor or firm can generally perform work less expensively than
            a full-time employee can, and the costs of hiring, training, and
            maintaining employees are eliminated, as are taxes and benefits.
          </li>
          <br /><br />
          <i>Here’s what you can, and should, be outsourcing.</i>
          <br /><br />
          1. Administrative tasks <br /><br />
          Scheduling, travel arrangements, data entry, typing and other
          administrative tasks can usually be handled by a virtual assistant or
          administrative service. While these tasks are crucial to the proper
          functioning of any business, they are not usually core business
          activities. <br /><br />
          Where to find help: Assistant Match, Assist, match businesses with
          screened administrative service providers and offer directories of
          professionally trained virtual assistants.
          <br /><br />
          2. Lead generation and customer service <br /><br />
          Sales calls are often a matter of numbers; more calls equal more sales
          and leads. Once the initial outreach has been made, closing the sale
          can be handled by the internal sales force. A talented salesperson’s
          skills can be better utilized to close sales and handle clients,
          rather than make cold calls. It can also be a great deal more
          efficient to outsource customer support than it is to maintain a
          qualified support staff, especially for product-based companies.
          <br /><br />
          3. Accounting and financial duties <br /><br />
          Accounting firms or individuals can help with many financial services
          including bookkeeping, invoicing and accounts payable and receivable,
          as well as financial reporting, analysis and planning. Outsourcing
          payroll processing alone can save considerable hours, headaches and
          dollars. Many financial contractors will bundle these tasks for even
          greater savings. <br /><br />
          4. Marketing <br /><br />
          Effective marketing determines how both brand and company reputation
          are perceived in the marketplace. A marketing firm or consultant can
          often provide an outside perspective that an internal marketing staff
          cannot. Professional freelance writers can develop higher-quality,
          polished content that will improve marketing efforts. Website design,
          brand development, press releases and online marketing duties such as
          social media, blogging and search engine optimization are good
          candidates for outsourcing as well. <br /><br />
          5. IT operations <br /><br />
          It can be extremely expensive to handle IT operations in-house. The
          average business has limited ability and knowledge to manage all of
          its IT needs. Unless you’re an IT company, IT is a maintenance and
          repair function, not a core business activity. The potential
          advantages of outsourcing IT tasks are enormous. <br /><br />
          6. Human resources <br /><br />
          Employee acquisition and human resource functions can easily be
          administered by an outside agency. Outside firms are more skilled at
          advertising, screening suitable applicants and checking references.
          Using an HR or employment service to manage employee benefits can also
          be wise, since they must stay up to date on the latest employment laws
          and standards. <br /><br />
          Often, the best way to locate high-quality outsourcing prospects is
          through recommendations from your professional network. A referral
          from someone you know and trust is a much more reliable gauge of
          quality and is usually based on the level of skill and not simply the
          cheapest cost. Professional groups or associations and LinkedIn can
          also be great sources. <br /><br />

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
