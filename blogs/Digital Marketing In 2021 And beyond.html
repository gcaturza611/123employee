          <h2>Digital Marketing In 2021 And beyond</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The digital marketing landscape may always be in a state of constant
          flux with technology changing all the time, but the one thing that
          never changes is the need for leads to fill company’s sales funnels.
          And a lot of these leads come from digital marketing efforts.
          <br /><br />
          Many companies find themselves trying to do it all, but when it comes
          to filling the sales pipeline it might be most beneficial to place the
          process of collecting leads through digital efforts in the hands of
          the most capable. If that’s in-house, great! However, the complex
          world of digital marketing is often more cost effective to partner
          with a third-party expert.
          <br /><br />
          Focus on what your business does best.
          <br /><br />
          When launching a business, it’s critical to do what you are good at;
          sticking with your core competency is an absolute must. So, before
          deciding whether to partner with the experts you need to understand
          your company and its capabilities.
          <br /><br />
          If you’re fantastic at creating a product, but not so good at taking
          it to market, then that should be your main focus and you should let
          the experts handle creating the demand to drive sales.
          <br /><br />
          A lot of companies have limited resources in the way of marketing,
          with interns or a very small team responsible for driving all channels
          including email, paid search, search engine optimization (SEO),
          content creation, social media presence, etc. While most of these
          channels are relatively easy to setup, not everyone understand how to
          drive results or there are simply too many to manage efficiently and
          effectively for a small team.
          <br /><br />
          Marketing is not cheap and is often one of the first budgets to get
          cut when costs need to decrease. The general rule of thumb suggests
          between 6-20 percent of total revenue for most businesses’ marketing
          budget. This includes all paid advertisements, all of the necessary
          tools, and the salaries of the staff members if you choose to keep
          your efforts in-house.
          <br /><br />
          Inbound marketing is all about creating new leads for your business.
          If you opt for in-house, full-time digital marketing staff, it’s going
          to entail a significant investment of both time and money.
          <br /><br />
          Financial concerns aside, the digital marketing industry is changing
          all the time. Frankly, the task of planning and carrying out your
          marketing efforts may be so time-consuming that it makes it
          near-impossible to stay up to date with every new strategy and trend
          that comes along.
          <br /><br />
          Third-party partners dedicate their entire business to making sure
          they are aware of the latest trends in digital marketing, so the
          burden of doing so does not fall to their client. They are often
          flexible and have the ability to pivot based on new technology or the
          latest best practice.
          <br /><br />
          Perhaps you’re not ready to relinquish complete control of your
          digital marketing efforts. There is always the option of taking a
          blended approach and only partnering with the experts for tasks you
          feel the least comfortable managing like SEO which can be rather
          complex.
          <br /><br />
          They will be able to help you in the planning stage to help you best
          utilize your budget to help you avoid gaps and keep new leads coming
          into your sales funnel.

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              everyday, I highlight the parts that are action items, I email her
              my notes everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all
              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
