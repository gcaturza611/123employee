          <h2>BUSINESS OUTSOURCING TIPS</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          The global economic environment is caught up with an interesting trend
          known as outsourcing. Business outsourcing covers different areas of a
          company or organization’s business activities and operations.
          Outsourcing has completely changed the mode of operating business in
          this present dispensation. <br /><br />
          Basically, there is in-country outsourcing and offshore outsourcing.
          When a company outsources part of its business activities to an
          outsourcing contractor in the same country where the business is
          residing, this is called in-country outsourcing. But, when the
          outsourcing contractor resides in another part of the world other than
          the country where the outsourced company resides, this is known as
          offshore outsourcing. Business IT is one of the most outsourced
          operations or functions, both in-country and offshore.
          <br /><br />
          <b><i>Why Should You Outsource Your Business Operations</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          <b>1. It can be cost-effective</b> <br /><br />
          Business outsourcing can be cost-effective sometimes compared to
          carrying out the functions in-house. The overall cost of certain areas
          of business operations such as IT Management can be greatly reduced by
          embarking on outsourcing. Generally, areas covered under cost-savings
          include re-pricing, scope reduction, cost-restructuring,
          re-negotiation as well as quality levels definitions.
          <br /><br />
          <b>2. Access to Talent</b> <br /><br />
          An organization or company gains access to a larger talent pool when
          it chooses business outsourcing. Such company would also become a
          beneficiary of sustainable source of skills, particularly in IT,
          engineering as well as science. This is a big plus to a company that
          has limited or less knowledge and skill set in these specified areas.
          So, a company needs not to lag in certain areas just because it does
          not have the required manpower skills or adequate facilities in such
          area. Outsourcing has made everything possible for a business or
          organization.
          <br /><br />
          <b>3. Liability Shift</b> <br /><br />
          As a company outsources specific business processes or functions that
          are not within its core expertise, it indirectly shifts or transfers
          part of the company’s liability to the outsourcing contractor. Thus,
          the outsourcing company bears part or whole responsibility of any
          undesirable out come. Well, it all depends on the terms of the
          contract that is binding on both parties. Now, when embarking on
          business outsourcing, ensure that sufficient research is carried out
          on the outsourcing contractor. Some of the things you should research
          about the company include;
          <br /><br />
          Proof of required skill possession in the intended business operation
          or function. An outsourcing company that is specialized in IT
          outsourcing may not perform satisfactorily in HR outsourcing, except
          it has multi-skilled staff. It is really more efficient to contract a
          company that has proven skills in the business area you need
          outsourced.
          <br /><br />
          Check the portfolio: the portfolio should contain certifications in
          specific outsourcing areas as well as general outsourcing
          certifications. It should also contain proof of membership to relevant
          outsourcing body, either locally or internationally. Also, references
          of past projects and their contacts should be part of the portfolio of
          a competent business outsourcing vendor.
          <br /><br />
          <i
            >Business outsourcing will help your business in several areas,
            including gaining a competitive edge in the present harsh business
            environment.</i

              I am so amazed at the professionalism of 123Employee but even more
              important, Cassie, as my Virtual Assistant, is wonderful! She
              really takes on the tasks with full responsibility. She even makes
              suggestions and researches ideas that will bring me business or
              traffic to my website. The only thing she can’t do is bring me
              coffee! Our Mall Stars Video Production Studios is a concept that
              we expect to go national, and frankly I believe that with Cassie
              as my Virtual Assistant and Daven’s company 123Employee, my
              chances of making that happen will greatly increase!

              She took seven thousand Gmail contacts and sorted them into
              folders. It was amazing! Everyday she checks my inbox, filters
              things, she sorts them, she gets rid of the junk, she took my PDF
              copies of all my expenses for the last year's bank statement, and
              categorized all of them. Amazing! She saves me so much time which
              is unbelievable. I have to ask her, she comes to me when she’s
              done with the project, she says Collin what else do you have for
              me? I mean when else do you ever get that kind of treatment from
              somebody? I had to go back to Daven with a long list of stuff to
              figure out. Oh! she can do this, she can do that and then I give
              her another project plus the ongoing stuff she has. So you gotta
              get 123Employee, check it out, call Daven, it will be the best
              thing you’ve ever done.

              my notes everyday and she creates another visual mind map of all
              the actions I need to take. When I get home I know exactly what I
              need to do. Maria has been amazing, she’s always ready to please,
              she’s always friendly, she’s always helpful. I am just so grateful

              I’ve been working with 123 for a couple of years now, and I can
              tell you they have made all the difference in the success of my
              business and the reason my business has grown and continuesto
              generate more and more income. Now one of the things that’s been
              great is it’s freed me up from having to do all the tasks that I
              simply just don’t have time to do. It allowed me just to focus on
              the IGAs or income generating activities in my business.

              I got to tell you, before we got involved in 123Employee and
              outsourcing some of our scheduling and inbound and outbound calls
              and our social media, we had an office that was completely
              disorganized and messy. Just to give you a quick example, 6 months
              ago my Twitter account had a couple of thousand followers, now as
              of today I’m in about 20,000. You can check that out, very easy
              for you to go check out, you can follow me on Twitter and figure
              that out all on your own and I got to tell you the outsourced
              employees over there are friendly, they’re fantastic, they get
              done what they say they’re going to do in less time that I could
              ever find somebody here to do it. I highly, highly recommend using
              123Employee to take care of all of your tasks.
